Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Continues Upswing Market angst stemming from news updates on Russia led to a slide in the index to 20/100 on Monday morning. Responding to Bitcoins Monday breakout, the index surged to 51/100 this morning. Significantly, the index also moved out of the Extreme Fear zone and returned to the Neutral zone. For the Bitcoin bulls, the index will need to move back through to 54/100 to bring $50,000 levels back into play for Bitcoin. A fall to sub-20/100 would deliver sub-$30,000 levels. For the crypto market, the upside came despite bearish sentiment across the mainstream markets. Mondays moves could prove to be a material one in Bitcoin and the crypto markets status in the global financial markets. Before Mondays rally, Bitcoin had closely tracked the likes of the NASDAQ 100. The correlation had left Bitcoin in the hands of the news wires and the NASDAQ 100 before Mondays decoupling. Bitcoin Price Action At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.22% to $43,286. Technical Indicators Bitcoin will need to avoid the $41,542 pivot to make a run on the First Major Resistance Level at $45,608. Bitcoin would need broader market support to break through to $45,000. Story continues In the event of another extended rally, the Second Major Resistance Level at $48,030 and resistance at $50,000 would come into play. The Third Major Resistance Level sits at $54,500. A fall through the pivot would bring the First Major Support Level at $39,120 into play. Barring an extended sell-off throughout the day, Bitcoin should avoid sub-$39,000 levels. The Second Major Support Level sits at $35,050. Looking at the EMAs and the 4-hourly candlestick chart (above), it is a less bearish signal. Bitcoin now sits well above the 200-day EMA. The 50-day EMA has narrowed to the 100-day and 200-day EMAs this morning. A bullish cross of the 50-day EMA through the 100-day EMA would bring $50,000 into play. Bitcoin would need to avoid the 200-day EMA, currently at $40,400, to support another breakout day.

Georgieva said that the IMF has been “deeply involved” in CBDC research, and has provided “technical assistance” to many member countries as they pursue the development of their own CBDCs.\nThrough the IMF’s involvement in CBDC development around the world, Georgieva said the organization has learned three lessons.\nFirst, CBDCs aren’t a one-size-fits-all technology. Georgieva told attendees that because each economy is different, CBDCs will play a different role in every country. In nations that are less economically developed, Georgieva suggested that CBDCs could help with financial inclusion, and in others, they could act as a backup payment method.\nSecond, Georgieva told attendees that the IMF sees both privacy and financial stability as “paramount” to the design of CBDCs. She touted the benefits of CBDCs that are not interest bearing in order to prevent a decline in use of traditional banks, as well as the utility of placing limits on holdings of CBDCs to “prevent sudden outflows of bank deposits into CBDC.”\n“In many countries, privacy concerns are a potential deal breaker when it comes to CBDC legislation and adoption,” Georgieva added. “So it’s vital that policymakers get the mix right.”\nPrivacy concerns around China’s digital yuan – which Georgieva spotlighted in her speech as being one of the six central banks at the “frontier” of CBDC development – did not factor into her speech.\nFinally, Georgieva concluded by urging central banks to find “balance” between the design and policy of CBDCs, to consider public-private partnerships to work on features of the CBDCs and to keep financial stability in mind.\nRead more:IMF Urges El Salvador to Discontinue Bitcoin’s Legal Tender Status\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":86,\"stop_loss\":40225.19,\"take_profit\":46161.28,\"forecast_10d\":[43924.12, 42451.79, 39137.61, 39400.59, 38419.98, 38062.04, 38737.27, 41982.93, 39437.46, 38794.97]}"}

Once that is crossed, Bitcoin could reach a $1 trillion market capitalization. McGlone anticipates the uptrend to continue in 2021, and there are a growing number of analysts who agree with his view.Veteran trader Peter Brandt also believes that if previous bull runs are considered, Bitcoin is in the early stages of its next bull cycle.Daily cryptocurrency market performance. Source: Coin360In another bullish projection, Citibank managing director Tom Fitzpatrick believes that Bitcoin could rally to $318,000 by December 2021. Fitzpatrick arrived at this forecast by considering the previous bull markets in Bitcoin. Every bull phase witnesses considerable corrections on the way up, and these provide opportunities for traders to sell high and buy again during dips. However, in order to do this, traders have to time their trades, otherwise they may miss out on the move.Let’s analyze the top 10 cryptocurrencies to spot any bearish or bullish setups that could project the next possible move. BTC/USDIn a strong uptrend, corrections usually do not last more than three days. This can be seen in Bitcoin’s rally that started in early October. The bulls have pushed the price above the overhead resistance at $16,500 and resumed the upward move.BTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe BTC/USD pair could now rally to the next significant resistance at $17,200. Here again, the bulls may have to overcome strong selling by the bears because once the buyers clear this resistance, there is no major hurdle until the all-time highs.The rising moving averages and the relative strength index in overbought territory suggest that bulls are in control. There is no negative formation on the chart that warns of a possible top at the current juncture.Still, traders should be careful and not get carried away with strength. They can keep a close eye on the 20-day exponential moving average ($15,032) because a break below it will be the first sign of weakness.ETH/USDEther (ETH) has been facing selling pressure at the resistance line of the rising wedge pattern. This line has now reached close to the overhead resistance at $488.134. Hence, the bears are likely to mount a strong defense of this level.ETH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the price turns down from the overhead resistance and the bulls do not give up much ground, then it will increase the possibility of a breakout of $488.134. Above this level, the ETH/USD pair could rally to $520 and then to $550.The upsloping moving averages and the RSI above 61 suggest that bulls have the upper hand. This bullish view will be negated if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and plummets below the 20-day EMA ($435). XRP/USDXRP broke and closed above the $0.26 resistance on Nov. 13. Although the bears sold the rallies on Nov. 14 and 15, they could not pull the price back below the breakout level of $0.26. XRP/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThis shows that the sentiment has turned positive and the bulls are accumulating on dips. The 20-day EMA ($0.256) has turned up, and the RSI has reached the overbought zone, which suggests that the path of least resistance is to the upside.The first target on the upside is $0.303746 and if this level is scaled, the XRP/USD pair could retest the $0.326113 resistance. This bullish view will be invalidated if the pair turns down and plummets below the $0.26 support. LINK/USDChainlink's\\xa0LINK\\xa0is currently attempting to bounce off the 20-day EMA ($12). The bulls will now again try to propel the price above the $13.28 overhead resistance. If they succeed, the altcoin will complete an inverse head-and-shoulders pattern.LINK/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe target objective of this bullish setup is $19.2731. The gradually rising moving averages and the RSI just above the midpoint suggest a minor advantage to the bulls.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current levels or the overhead resistance and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the LINK/USD pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($11). A break below $9.7665 will invalidate the bullish setup.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) once again turned down from the overhead resistance zone of $272 to $280 on Nov. 15. This shows that the bears are defending this level aggressively. If the bears can sink the price below the immediate support at $242, a drop to $231 is possible.BCH/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($256) is flat, while the 50-day SMA ($249) is moving up, and the RSI has been trading between 40 and 60 levels. This suggests a balance between supply and demand.Trading inside a range can be volatile and difficult to predict. Hence, it is better to trade when the price reaches the support or resistance of the range. Another possibility is to wait for the price to break above or below the range before taking large bets.If the bulls can push the price above $280, the BCH/USD pair could rally to $326.30. Conversely, a drop below $231 may sink the price to $200.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) has soared and broken out of the overhead resistance at $68.9008. If the bulls can sustain the price above the breakout level, it will signal the possible start of a new uptrend. The next target on the upside is $80, then $100. LTC/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, the bears are unlikely to give up easily. They will try to fake the current breakout and pull the price back below $68.9008. If they succeed, it will suggest strong selling close to the $70 mark.If the price sustains below $68.9008, the bears will then try to drag the LTC/USD pair down to the $64 support. If they can do that, it will suggest that the upward momentum has weakened. BNB/USDThe bears are trying to sink Binance Coin (BNB) below the tight range of $27.30 to $28.97. The downsloping 20-day EMA ($28.29) and the RSI below 47 suggest an advantage to the bears.BNB/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf the BNB/USD pair dips below $27.30, the next stop could be $25.6652. This is an important support, as the bulls have defended it aggressively on two previous occasions. A strong rebound of this support will increase the possibility that the pair may consolidate in the $25.6652–$32 range for a few more days.Contrary to this assumption, if the pair rebounds off the current levels and rises above the 20-day EMA, the bulls will again try to push the price above $28.97. If they succeed, a rally to $30 and then to $32 will be on the cards.DOT/USDPolkadot's DOT\\xa0bounced off the 20-day EMA ($4.36) on Nov. 12, but the bulls could not push the price above the minor resistance at $4.63. This suggests a lack of demand at higher levels.DOT/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, the bulls have again purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA and are currently attempting to push the price above the immediate resistance at $4.63. If they manage to do that, the DOT/USD pair could rally to $4.95.The marginally upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory suggest an advantage to the bulls. This positive view will be invalidated if the pair turns down from the current levels and breaks below the moving averages. In such a case, a drop to $3.80 is possible.ADA/USD Cardano's ADA\\xa0slipped below the moving averages on Nov. 15, but the bulls are trying to defend the support at $0.098822. If the altcoin rebounds and rises above the moving averages, the bulls will again try to push the price to $0.1142241.ADA/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewA breakout and close above the downtrend line will be the first sign of strength. Contrary to this assumption, if the ADA/USD pair turns down from the downtrend line and plummets below $0.098822, it could drop to $0.0893.As the bulls had purchased the previous two declines to $0.0893, they are likely to attempt it again. Hence, a bounce off this support could extend the stay of the pair inside the range. The flat moving averages and the RSI near the halfway mark also point to a range-bound action for the next few days.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) again turned down from the 20-day EMA ($161) on Nov. 14, which suggests that the bears are selling on minor rallies. If the selling continues, the altcoin could drop to the critical support at $146.BSV/USD daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe downsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI below 49 suggest a minor advantage to the bears. However, one positive development is the bullish divergence on the RSI. This suggests that the downside momentum may be weakening.If the bulls can push the price above the downtrend line, it could clear the path for a rally to $181. The next trending move is likely to start after the bulls drive the price above $181 or the bears sink the price below $146.

Not only did the fund say it &#x201C;may hold long and short positions in digital assets,&#x201D; but Skybridge might also invest in other types of cryptos alongside bitcoin (BTC).

A number of reports show that banks with a large amount of commercial real estate in their portfolios may see a significant fallout in the next few months. Just recently PWC&#x2019;s real estate practice published a report called &#x201C;The 2021 Emerging Trends,&#x201D; which shows city ranks have changed a great deal since the coronavirus outbreak. For instance, for a number of years, the city of Seattle was a top ten city for real-estate investment but after Covid-19, it dropped to No. 34 in terms of ratings with other American cities. One of the biggest issues major cities like Seattle, Boston, New York, L.A., Atlanta, and many more cities face, is the mounting commercial real estate (CRE) losses looming on the horizon. For instance, on November 11, 2020, columnist David J. Lynch published an article about how the current CRE market should frighten financial institutions like banks. The editorial explains how the Manhattan-based Signature Bank&#x2019;s third-quarter earnings had shown &#x201C;60 percent of its portfolio tied up in commercial real estate.&#x201D; Lynch further explains that lending funds to businesses like hotels, landlords, and local shops used to be something banks could count on but in cities like New York, these places are now a &#x201C;ghost town.&#x201D; Signature Bank is suffering badly from the fallout, as Lynch further states: The bank&#x2019;s bad-loan write-offs, though still modest, are creeping higher. Despite years of steady profits, investors have punished the stock, which even after a recent rebound has lost 27 percent of its value this year. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Basically, commercial real estate or CRE is a type of property that is leveraged exclusively for business purposes. An extremely large portion of the world&#x2019;s CRE is leased to those who generate an income but due to Covid-19 and the government&#x2019;s response to the virus, some people leasing CRE cannot generate income. The CRE crisis looming in the United States is happening in nearly every state of the nation. On November 16, 2020, Jdsupra published a report that covers Delaware and the horrible effects the response to Covid-19 has had on commercial real estate tenants and landlords. &#x201C;The real estate industry in Delaware experienced dramatic changes over the past eight months resulting from the Covid-19 pandemic&#x2014; Without a regular income stream, many commercial tenants cannot meet their monthly rent obligations,&#x201D; Jdsupra contributor John Newcomer, Jr writes. &#x201C;Facing diminished monthly rental income, some landlords are left with a cash shortfall that affects their ability to make mortgage payments to their banks.&#x201D; Meanwhile, the Federal eviction ban enacted by the CDC will be lifted at the end of the year and skeptics think it could trigger a wake of delinquencies. Local authorities from hard-hit CRE markets like New York and California are trying to curb the fallout by adding further regulations. For instance, California will continue to limit annual property tax increases for CRE markets. Moreover, analysts say no matter who is in office come January, no U.S. President will be able to affect returns on CRE. According to a recently published report from Cushman & Wakefield, real-estate downturns are guided by intense recessions no matter which political party is in charge of the United States. &#x201C;Rather than elections,&#x201D; stressed the Cushman & Wakefield report, &#x201C;the real estate cycle, the economy, interest rates, COVID-19, geopolitical events, and long-term growth drivers (like demographics and technological change) are the areas to focus on in determining leasing fundamentals and property values.&#x201D; Meanwhile, besides CRE and residential real estate, the investment assets gold and bitcoin have seen different price changes in recent days. For instance, after the Moderna vaccine announcement on Monday, spot gold prices dropped 0.40% and one ounce of fine gold is trading for $1,888 per unit. Gold also staggered in value when Pfizer announced a vaccine for Covid-19 as well, but crypto-asset markets have done the exact opposite. For instance, after the Moderna vaccine announcement, bitcoin (BTC) touched a high of $16,850 on the exchange Bitstamp rising 5.6%. Ethereum prices jumped 3.39% on Monday touching a high of $464 during Monday&#x2019;s afternoon trading sessions. The entire crypto market economy is still nearing a half of a trillion dollars at $464 billion which is up 2.6% on Monday.

Flash forward years later I watched what happened in 2017 and started doing research.  When it crashed from 2017s peak I wanted to buy some so bad, but I have been poor literally my entire adult life.

I started researching btc again because the gains caught my eye but the tech and ideology made a believer out of me.  Anyways covid hit and btc dumped to around 4k and I committed as big as I could.  I had to cash some out recently (don't trip im still holding id never sell it all lol) to buy my girlfriend of five years a ring.  We've been together almost five years and has had my back on everything thick and thin.  She used to help me out when I didn't have enough to pay the bills, and thanks to bitcoin I was finally able to afford to give her a ring that she absolutely loves.  On top of that, btc has also given me the ability to buy that ring, and still be financially stable!

In what is being one of the most polarising elections in US history, president Donald Trump will take on Democrat hopeful Joe Biden on November 3. A negative reaction to the result in traditional markets will increase demand for safe haven assets like gold and Bitcoin, although it must be stated that Bitcoin has shown signs of correlation with the stock market in 2020. Andrew Maguire, precious metals specialist at Kinesis , said: “Potential outcomes of the upcoming US elections are driving safe-haven demand. Uncertainty around factors such as candidates’ regulatory and tax policies could spark negative reactions from traditional market players, driving more investors towards gold and silver. U.S. Futures Rise on Stimulus Hope; Bonds Fall: Markets Wrap. We see nothing big coming before US election! Don’t get trapped #SPX #GOLD #SILVER https://t.co/NadJ98Epeb — Ravi (@BullvsBears) October 19, 2020 “Elsewhere, market volatility has been exacerbated recently when President Trump tested positive for COVID-19. With the gold price rising following the black swan event, we expect gold to gain strength amid such uncertainty.” Both Trump and Biden have remained fairly impartial and diplomatic on the topic of cryptocurrencies, but with increased attention surrounding global CBDCs and institutional inflow into Bitcoin, the two candidates may be forced into taking a strategic approach next term. At the time of writing Bitcoin is trading 191.22% higher than its yearly low at $11,672, while gold is forming a bullish pennant at $1,909, which was its previous all-time high dating back to 2011.

The last time anyone really thought about safety in markets was during the financial crisis more than a decade ago, when investors couldn’t get enough government bonds or cash.\nBut as the economy recovered, so did investors’ appetite for risk. A sort of cult of equity developed, with the unshakable belief that stocks would keep going up, and if they ever went down – which they did fairly sharply in the second half of 2015 and the end of 2018 - they would always come back – which they always did. “Buy the dip” became an actual strategy. The American Association of Individual Investors found that its members had an almost 66% allocation to stocks in December, up from 41% at the bottom of the financial crisis.\nMore importantly, the definition of safe morphed as stocks soared to new heights. If you went to your financial advisor and told him or her that your risk tolerance was low, he or she probably would have put your money in a portfolio of stocks that had a history of rising, not because they had any defensive qualities. But as we have seen this month, all stocks can go down with equal ferocity. That cult of equity has been shattered – perhaps permanently.\nThe prevailing feature of this bear market is that nothing has really been safe. If you had any exposure to bonds, it was probably in the form of investment grade or high-yield, high-risk debt, which were down almost as much as stocks until the stimulus packages from the government and Federal Reserve. And nobody contemplated a scenario where municipal bonds would not be safe. General obligation munis are backed by the unlimited taxing power of municipalities, but yet they were not spared, and that market ceased functioning.\nU.S. Treasury notes and bonds did provide some diversification benefits, but only to a point. After yields bottomed a couple of weeks ago, a massive unwinding of certain trades and the promise of massive government borrowing to fund the fiscal rescue plan drove yields higher. For decades, bonds mixed with stocks was good enough to achieve diversification, but will probably be less useful going forward.\nGold has been a bit of a disappointment. The whole reason people buy it is for situations like this, and it hasn’t worked, initially taking a big dive from about $1,680 an ounce to $1,471 in a matter of weeks. Although something similar happened in the last crisis, with gold peaking early at $1,000 as Bear Stearns collapsed, and then proceed to go down as the financial system unraveled, before finally turning and surging to $1,900. Although gold has rebounded somewhat, those expecting gold to go up when stocks went down were let down. Similarly, Bitcoin has also been less than underwhelming. The digital currency, which sometimes trades like a haven asset, has mostly traded as a risk asset instead, though it has also recovered somewhat just like with gold.\nMoney market funds are struggling to avoid a situation like what happened in 2008, when the Lehman Brothers bankruptcy caused the Reserve Primary fund to “break the buck,” which led to a run on money market funds. The commercial paper market is smaller than it used to be, but money market and ultrashort duration bond funds don’t strike me as very safe here without help from the Fed.\nOnly Treasury bills or cash would have provided you with the safety you desired. But cash has its own set of issues and concerns. If you have more than $250,000 in one bank, there is a chance that it’s not entirely safe, either, which people were forced to think about in 2008. Also, it looks like the government and the Fed will be dropping money out of helicopters, and people are - perhaps prematurely - starting to talk about inflation again. So on a long-term basis, cash makes less sense.\nAs for as the safety of different investment vehicles, exchange-traded funds that own bonds are again taking heat for trading at a significant discount to their underlying assets (though I wrote about this a few years ago, and it is a feature, not a bug, of ETFs). And we are again looking at a situation where there is a possibility that open-end mutual funds might gate redemptions for liquidity reasons.\nAll of this forces an investor to ask themselves what is safe? Is anything really safe? The days of dollar-cost-averaging a standard portfolio where 80% is invested in stocks and 20% is invested in bonds and watching your money grow at 10% a year and end up with a few million dollars at retirement are likely over. Returns will undoubtedly be lower, forcing people to save more and consume less—which is not what is needed for an economic recovery.\nMy beliefs about risk were shaped years ago reading books such as “The Black Swan” and “The (Mis)behavior of Markets,” which focused on ideas like how financial markets follow a power-law distribution, and not a normal distribution, and that markets are vulnerable to large, unforeseen events. Knowing this, you try to build a portfolio that gives you a modicum of exposure to the upside, but truncates your exposure to the downside.\nThe bears and the financial doomsday preppers were widely ridiculed during the bull market. I won’t say they have been vindicated, but people’s perception of risk has been forever altered.\nThis column does not necessarily reflect the opinion of Bloomberg LP and its owners.\nJared Dillian is the editor and publisher of The Daily Dirtnap, investment strategist at Mauldin Economics, and the author of \"Street Freak\" and \"All the Evil of This World.\" He may have a stake in the areas he writes about.\nFor more articles like this, please visit us atbloomberg.com/opinion\nSubscribe nowto stay ahead with the most trusted business news source.\n©2020 Bloomberg L.P. || (Bloomberg Opinion) -- If the recent selloff in markets proves anything, it’s that for too many years too many people were focused solely on returns with zero consideration for risk or safety.

James Bond wore it in “Thunderball,” although his featured a miniature Geiger counter. The company has rereleased the watch, black and white “panda” face and all, to a new generation and it’s doing something a bit different this time. Instead of offering a certificate of authenticity, the company is registering each watch on a private blockchain that will follow its provenance from owner to owner. As such, it’s a rare example of an enterprise blockchain project that made its way to real-world deployment; most corporate dabbling with distributed ledgers has resulted in little more than hype. Related: Bitcoin News Roundup for March 30, 2020 “The Breitling Top Time Limited Edition will be the brand’s first watch offered with a blockchain-based digital passport, which confirms the authenticity and ownership of the watch with a single click,” the company said in a press release. Breitling is using a blockchain from valuables registrar Arianee , a French company whose aim is to build “perpetual relationships between brands and owners.” The solution ties the watch’s warranty to the watch itself and not to any paper trail, allowing owners to have their pieces serviced by authorized dealers based on the watch’s digital signature. The Arianee blockchain combines permissioned and permissionless elements through its use of a consensus mechanism it’s calling “proof-of-authority.” It is permissionless in the sense that users who want to sell products to one another can interact with the blockchain, but the verifying of the ledger and issuance of tokens is controlled by the participating businesses. Breitling, founded in 1884, is being a good sport about the project, saying the system allows users to “engage with the brand anonymously” and take part in “new online services ranging from advanced clienteling to a revolutionary care program.” Related: Old Rivals Oracle and IBM Want Their Blockchains to Talk to Each Other The watch nerd will note that the Top Time has a linear scale on its bezel instead of a tachymeter . This is called a decimal scale and was offered on some watches in the 1960s. It was, apparently , used for scientific timings, splitting each minute into 100 sections rather than the usual 60. The watch costs $4,990, or about 80 percent of the current price of one bitcoin . Breitling, one of the first manufacturers to offer online sales , is shipping the Top Time this month.

Fourth-quarter results were better than expected , but that was merely a reprieve after horrendous third-quarter results . Here are four important takeaways for investors from the filing. Man wearing Spectacles and holding his arm out Image source: Snap. Head count growth is slowing After growing too quickly for a couple years, Snap employees have been hit with numerous rounds of layoffs . CEO Evan Spiegel has acknowledged that Snap hired too aggressively, while certain products underperformed -- most notably Spectacles -- and required layoffs to cut costs. Snap is now focusing on trying to make its existing workforce more productive, although it will still hire as necessary. On the earnings call earlier this month, CFO Drew Vollero said, \"Head count growth continues to moderate, thanks to productivity gains from our team. Net additions in the quarter were slightly more than 100, one-third of the rate of recent quarters.\" According to the filling, Snap finished 2017 with 3,069 employees. Chart showing Snap head count Data source: SEC filings and earnings conference calls. Chart by author. The rate of headcount growth has indeed slowed. The redesign is risky Snap is in the midst of a crisis right now related to the major redesign that is rolling out this quarter. There has been considerable user backlash, including most recently from celebrity Kylie Jenner . At least two Street analysts have downgraded Snapchat shares due to the inherent risk associated with such an ambitious undertaking. The company has now added additional risk factor legalese to acknowledge it: Additionally, we introduced a major redesign of the Snapchat application in December 2017 that rolled out more broadly in February 2018, which has received negative attention in the press and in app store reviews. The short- and long-term impact of any major change, like our recent redesign, is particularly difficult to predict. If new or enhanced products fail to engage our users, advertisers, or partners, we may fail to attract or retain users or to generate sufficient revenue, operating margin, or other value to justify our investments, any of which may seriously harm our business in the short term, long term, or both. Story continues Once the deployment is complete, investors should pay close attention to Snap's reported user metrics to gauge the overall reception. Excessive executive compensation Snap also discloses the total compensation packages for its top execs. Name Title 2017 Total Compensation Evan Spiegel CEO $637.8 million Imran Khan Chief strategy officer $100.6 million Michael Sullivan General counsel $16.8 million Data source: 10-K. Spiegel's compensation stands out as excessive, which Reuters points out is the third-highest CEO payout ever. But that was already known: Snap gave Spiegel a massive IPO award for taking the company public. Snap had initially estimated that the stock-based compensation (SBC) expense associated with the award would be about $624.8 million, but I estimated it to be closer to $636.6 million since Spiegel ended up receiving more shares than originally planned because the offering was oversubscribed. That figure is exactly what Snap recognized for Spiegel's SBC expense, with the remaining $1.2 million including a $98,000 salary and $1.1 million in other compensation. That last amount includes \"membership fees for a concierge medical service\" for Spiegel. The most disconcerting part of the IPO award was that it vested immediately, requiring Snap to recognize those SBC expenses up front and foregoing any retentive effects. Spiegel and Murphy maintain their iron grip In a corporate governance travesty, public Snap shareholders get no votes whatsoever. In addition to some Class B shares (1 vote per share), Spiegel and co-founder Robert Murphy hold supervoting Class C shares (10 votes per share) and wield absolute control over the company. This is also old news, but Snap again details how much voting power the two young executives command. Executive Voting Power Evan Spiegel 48.4% Robert Murphy 47.4% Total 95.8% Data source: 10-K. If shareholders are unhappy with how Snap is run, there's nothing they can do about it other than to sell their shares.

The Ukrainian Security Service raid of the Odessa office of Forklog itself in December 2017 highlighted the potential for even authorities to indulge in criminal activity, while the abduction of EXMO exchange CEO Pavel Lerner in Kiev in December only ended after payment of a $1 mln ransom.\\n'], [15411, 'new-project-to-tackle-crypto-energy-crisis-by-generating-electricity-through-waste', 26431, 'New Project to Tackle Crypto Energy Crisis by Generating Electricity Through Waste', '2018-02-23 18:34:00', 'The company intends to produce their own energy and apply their own fixed price to sales, leading to a standardization of fees.', '\\nAs the cryptocurrency market expands, so too does the volume of energy required to maintain it. If the Bitcoin market alone continues to progress at its current rate,\\xa0it will soon consume more energy annually than countries such as Peru. One potential solution to this issue is renewable energy; and that is where\\xa04NEW hopes to come into play.\\nDescribing themselves as ‘world\\'s first eco-friendly, tangible, waste to energy Blockchain solution,’ 4NEW’s premise is to take waste products and transform them into a usable energy source. This technology has been in adoption for over 70 years with approximately 83 independent waste to energy plants already in use within the US and many more in other countries. This energy can be sold to the national grid, or used to power 4NEW’s own mining farm. Their\\xa0white paper explains that it will be cost-effective.\\n\\n\"The cost to produce the energy is met through the revenue generated from the waste collection services and sale of byproducts facilitating a sustainable operation at breakeven or a marginal profit. Therefore, the energy produced is unencumbered and freely available for utilization or sale to the national grid.\"\\n\\nIntegral to this system is the unique 4NEW crypto token, KWATT (currently ERC20, Ethereum based contract). Each of these embodies 1kW of electricity annually (the global average retail price per kW of electricity is currently $0.15). The ICO opened at the end of January and will continue until March 2018. Following this, 4NEW plan to open two new renewable-powered mining sites in the UK. These will initially produce 10 megawatts of electricity an hour, progressing to 40 megawatts an hour once the systems are fully up and running at maximum capacity. The estimated maximum capacity annually is 346 mln kW, scaled down to 300 mln kW to account for factors such as repairs and routine maintenance.\\nCrucially, as 4NEW will produce their own energy, they can apply their own fixed price to sales, leading to a standardization of fees. This sets it apart from other Blockchains which have to purchase their energy externally. This Blockchain enables KWATT coin holders to either sell the energy within their coins to the national grid or utilize them on 4NEW’s mining farms.\\n4NEW proudly state that their team holds over 300 years combined experience in crypto and Blockchain. CEO Sandeep Golechha says he hopes their methods of energy utilization will become industry standard, should their power plant, Blockchain and mining plant be fully operational by Q3 2018 as intended.\\nThe crypto energy crisis\\nThe huge energy costs associated with Bitcoin transaction and mining are growing and will continue to do so. 4NEW states on their\\xa0website that in just over 14 months, worldwide energy usage associated with Bitcoin transactions grew from the equivalent of 7.5 US households each day to that of 17.5 households.\\xa0Iceland already uses more energy on crypto mining than on powering households.\\xa0Other studies reveal its estimated usage of 42TWh of electricity a year exceeds countries such as New Zealand and Hungary (and 157 other countries) and consuming as much CO2 as one mln transatlantic flights. These daunting statistics highlight the urgent need for crypto to turn to renewable energy as a source– which 4NEW is helping to facilitate. Should the scheme continue to prove successful, the world could observe a substantial drop in energy costs associated with crypto, especially from mining farms using extremely polluting sources such as coal.\\n\\xa0\\n\\nDisclaimer.

All ICOs would be subject to registration requirements and would be required to offer something like a “digital prospectus.” The borderless aspects so befuddling regulators when it comes to bitcoin are to be considered this March with the advent of a Fintech Regulatory Council.

Thanks to its near-monopolization of the ASIC manufacturing business, Bitmain has effectively had a license to print money. This week, Bernstein analysts released a report into Bitmain’s operations. It estimates the Chinese firm to have made $3-$4 billion last year from mining cryptocurrency and for selling the equipment for others to do the same. Also read: Montana Scores $250 Million Bitcoin Mining Campus Big Bucks for Bitmain Ask any serious cryptocurrency miner what brand of ASIC they use and you’ll be greeted by the same two-syllable reply. Bitmain isn’t just the main player in the mining game – it’s pretty much the only one for miners seeking to make a living from their trade. Bitmain is a controversial company for a number of reasons, including its dominance of the bitcoin mining game, which goes against the principles of decentralization. Its mining units are prized, however, for their robustness, effectiveness, and consistent performance. If Bernstein’s figures are accurate, Bitmain pulled in the same amount as Nvidia last year. Yet while Nvidia is a household name, few people outside of the cryptocurrency space have even heard of Bitmain. Bernstein calculates Nvidia to have made $3 billion in 2017, but points out that it took 24 years for the company to attain that profit level; Bitmain has achieved the same feat in just four years. Neither Jihan Wu or Micree Zhan featured in Forbes’ recent Crypto Rich List, yet there is no doubt that Bitmain’s founders are very wealthy men. Bernstein&#8217;s report highlights in grey, in the diagram, where Bitmain made its money Perseverance Pays Off While critics may resent the stranglehold their company has over cryptocurrency mining, Wu and Zhan have earned their reward for starting their business when bitcoin was still unfashionable, in 2013, and staying the course. The bulk of the company’s profits came in the past 12 months, as the price of bitcoin soared. For most of this period, Bitmain insisted on taking payment in bitcoin only, and later in bitcoin cash. Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu Bitmain is a company of a few words, preferring to let its hardware do the talking. Predictably, it had nothing to say in response to Bernstein’s report and earnings estimate. According to Bernstein, Bitmain’s dominance of bitcoin mining and ASIC manufacture stands at around 70%. One of the reasons why Bitmain has been so immensely profitable is that it has been able to hike the price of its Antminers in response to bitcoin’s rise, while the manufacturing costs have remained the same. As a result, a single Antminer went from a few hundred dollars to a peak of $5,000 last year. The report went on to predict that Bitmain will further increase its dominance of the mining business this year, noting “Bitmain will likely lead the cryptocurrency asic industry and migrate some of its chips to 10nm and the most advanced 7nm. That will make the company one of the top five users of TSMC&#8217;s 7nm in 2018, with demand comparable with Qualcomm&#8217;s, HiSilicon&#8217;s, or AMD&#8217;s.&#8221; Do you think Bitmain&#8217;s dominance of the mining business is unhealthy?

Joking that the miners have taken over the central bank’s main duty – money emission, a deputy called for crypto regulations. The National Bank is actually working on proposals to regulate the crypto sector but is not planning a ban. Also read: Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, and Uzbekistan on the Crypto Radar State Computers Used to Mint Digital Coins IT specialists working for the Finance Ministry in four different regions of Kazakhstan have been implicated in using government hardware to mine cryptocurrencies. They were employed by local offices of the ministry’s Department of State Revenue, investigators said, quoted by Tengrinews. The miners have been exploiting the servers of the tax authority and the most powerful personal computers available to employees. “They have secretly installed mining software, which significantly decreased the speed of information processing and slowed down government computers”, Kazakhstan’s National Security Committee (KNB) said in a press release. “These programs have been added to the exceptions lists of antivirus applications”, the agency explained. “Criminal investigations have been launched against four employees of different regional divisions. KNB is in charge but we have started an internal inquiry, as well”, said Ardak Tangebaev, head of the Department of State Revenue. “We are going to tighten control over our IT departments”, he added. The employees have been charged with “impeding the work of information systems and telecommunications networks” and “creation, use or distribution of malicious computer programs and software products”. It is quite obvious that the current articles of the penal code do not specifically cover crypto-related crime. “Mining Under Your Nose” Kazakhstan’s financial authorities have been criticized for slowing down the introduction of regulations in the cryptocurrency sector. A deputy joked that the IT workers at the Finance Ministry have taken over one of the main responsibilities of the National Bank – emitting money. “They are mining under your nose and prosecutors have no idea about what charges to raise”, Gleb Shchegelskiy said, calling for crypto regulations in Kazakhstan. The central bank is actually working on a set of legislative proposals. New restrictions on operations with cryptocurrencies, like bitcoin, and their exchange with the local fiat tenge are to be imposed soon, according to NBK’s chairman Daniyar Akishev. “The situation indicates a necessity to toughen the requirements for the use of cryptocurrencies. We believe it is expedient to introduce legal restrictions”, he said, qu...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): Feb 23, 2018 15:30:00 UTC | 10,297.80$ | 8,369.50€ | 7,365.20£ | #Bitcoin #btc pic.twitter.com/kU8XAfTdXp || USD: 106.650\nEUR: 131.330\nGBP: 149.267\nAUD:  83.326\nNZD:  77.705\nCNY:  16.818\nCHF: 113.954\nBTC: 1,110,831\nETH: 94,310\nSat Feb 24  00:30 JST || #BTC Average: 10128.64$\n\n#Bitfinex - 10111.00$\n#Poloniex - 10099.00$\n#Bitstamp - 10137.04$\n#Coinbase - 10113.20$\n#Binance - 10100.00$\n#CEXio - 10262.50$\n#Kraken - 10122.50$\n#Cryptopia - 10075.00$\n#Bittrex - 10108.00$\n#GateCoin - 10158.20$\n\n#Bitcoin #Exchanges #Price || El valor actual del bitcoin es de 9875.00$ https://goo.gl/nb6gt8 pic.twitter.com/aQbehrmTZr || Current Bitcoin Price = $11434.34 --- Includes Sum of Forks, Core $10070.00 (88.07%) + Cash $1248.53 (10.92%) + Gold $115.80 (1.01%) || The current value of BTC at 03:24:08 on 24/02/2018 (AEST) is $12,900.00 AUD.\n#bitcoin #australia || At 2018/02/24 04:26:16\nBittrex.1 says: SELLING BTC-RDD at bittrex Rate: 9.6e-7 - Amount: 6315.78947368\nAveraged bought price was: 9.4e-7\nP/L for this trade is: 2.083%.\n(This is about 1.00 USD)\nBTC balance: 0.00555537\nRDD balance: 6315.78947368\nCheck this trade chart here htt || #BTC Average: 10073.73$\n\n#Bitfinex - 10050.00$\n#Poloniex - 10041.00$\n#Bitstamp - 10076.61$\n#Coinbase - 10051.00$\n#Binance - 10042.89$\n#CEXio - 10194.50$\n#Kraken - 10059.90$\n#Cryptopia - 10008.21$\n#Bittrex - 10054.97$\n#GateCoin - 10158.20$\n\n#Bitcoin #Exchanges #Price || #Bitcoin  -0.60% \nUltima: R$ 33700.02  Alta: R$ 35497.00 Baixa: R$ 31850.00\nFonte: Foxbit || BTC Price: 10065.00$, \nBTC Today High : 10405.50$, \nBTC All Time High : 19903.44$\nETH Price: 839.00$ #bitcoin #BTC $BTC #ETH $ETH #cryptopic.twitter.com/SV0xwvOxWd || Feb 23, 2018 17:30:00 UTC | 10,068.80$ | 8,187.10€ | 7,202.30£ | #Bitcoin #btc pic.twitter.com/BL2gUbnzdP || #BTC Average: 10114.93$\n\n#Bitfinex - 10097.17$\n#Poloniex - 10090.00$\n#Bitstamp - 10120.00$\n#Coinbase - 10080.04$\n#Binance - 10086.67$\n#CEXio - 10240.20$\n#Kraken - 10100.00$\n#Cryptopia - 10052.98$\n#Bittrex - 10124.00$\n#GateCoin - 10158.20$\n\n#Bitcoin #Exchanges #Price || #Cryptos: \n\n#BTC 10218.00$ | 8306.42€\n#XRP 0.99$ | 0.80€\n#ETH 849.37$ | 690.47€\n#LTC 207.10$ | 168.36€\n#DASH 625.57$ | 508.54€\n#XEM 0.44$ | 0.35€\n#IOTA 1.73$ | 1.41€\n#EOS 8.42$ | 6.84€\n#ETN 0.08$ | 0.06€\n#TRX 0.04$ | 0.03€\n\n#Cryptocurrency || #Cryptos: \n\n#BTC 10228.00$ | 8314.55€\n#XRP 0.99$ | 0.80€\n#ETH 851.65$ | 692.33€\n#LTC 207.65$ | 168.80€\n#DASH 626.08$ | 508.96€\n#XEM 0.44$ | 0.35€\n#IOTA 1.74$ | 1.41€\n#EOS 8.42$ | 6.85€\n#ETN 0.07$ | 0.06€\n#TRX 0.04$ | 0.03€\n\n#Cryptocurrency || #BTC Average: 10125.42$\n\n#Bitfinex - 10101.00$\n#Poloniex - 10121.08$\n#Bitstamp - 10100.01$\n#Coinbase - 10098.00$\n#Binance - 10105.00$\n#CEXio - 10248.90$\n#Kraken - 10120.00$\n#Cryptopia - 10088.00$\n#Bittrex - 10114.00$\n#GateCoin - 10158.20$\n\n#Bitcoin #Exchanges #Price || Top 5 Cryptocurrencies - Current Prices\n\nBitcoin $BTC: $10,228.00  -0.03%\nEthereum $ETH: $851.65  -0.36%\nRipple $XRP: $0.989933  +0.59%\nBitcoin Cash $BCH: $1,267.63  +0.32%\nLitecoin $LTC: $207.65  +0.23% || 23Feb2018 18:00 UTC #Bitcoin live spots - #XBTUSD @ 10,120.20000 $ - #XBTEUR @ 8,230.90000 € || $BTC is now worth $10,098.00 (-0.12%) #BTC || Bitcoin - BTC\nPrice: $10,228.00\nChange in 1h: -0.03%\nMarket cap: $172,670,885,900.00\nRanking: 1\n#Bitcoin #BTC || Current #Bitcoin price is $10100 (-2.00%).

Basically possession of the ETOMIC utxo proves you performed the atomic swap and we have ETH side contracts that implement the various hashlocking and time releases.

(NASDAQ: SINA) jumped 65% in 2017, according to data from S&P Global Market Intelligence , as the Chinese internet media leader's quarterly reports consistently exceeded Wall Street's expectations. That's not to say it was a completely smooth ride up for SINA investors. Keeping in mind SINA also climbed nearly 30% in 2016 , its first big move of 2017 was a 12% single-day plunge in late February despite posting particularly strong fourth-quarter 2016 results. Man on ladder drawing a chart on a brick wall showing volatile stock gains. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES So what But it didn't take long for SINA to recoup those early losses. To start, shares skyrocketed almost 30% in the month May on the heels of SINA's even better first-quarter 2017 announcement. That report was punctuated by accelerated revenue and user growth at SINA's Weibo (NASDAQ: WB) microblogging website, and an in-line performance from SINA's core media business in what was a seasonally slow period. And though shares subsequently pulled back in June when SINA announced a partial distribution of its ownership in Weibo -- through which it reduced its equity stake in the site to 46% from 49%, but retained 72% of the company's voting power -- the climb resumed following SINA's strong Q2 results in August thanks again to the relative outperformance of Weibo. Now what More recently in November, the seesaw continued with shares dropping nearly 12% after SINA's third-quarter report handily beat Wall Street's expectations. Quarterly revenue climbed 62% year over year to $443.1 million, including 56% growth in advertising revenue driven by Weibo and its 376 million monthly active users. But this time, SINA also saw 98% growth in non-ad revenue driven by a combination of Weibo membership fees, live broadcasting products, and new revenue from SINA's burgeoning online finance business. SINA chairman and CEO Charles Chao rightly said he was \"pleased\" with their performance, noting SINA had just set fresh records for both revenue and operating income. Story continues As it stands, SINA's fourth-quarter report is slated for mid-February, and expectations are high with consensus estimates calling for revenue to climb nearly 55% to $481.3 million. But with both Weibo and SINA's namesake businesses firing on all cylinders, it won't surprise anyone if the company manages to exceed all expectations yet again.

However, it is unlikely to be easy because the bulls will mount a strong defense at the zone.\\nIf the price rises from the current level or rebounds off $31,000, the buyers will again try to push the price to $36,670. A breakout of this resistance will be the first indication of strength. That will clear the path for an up-move to $42,451.67.\\nBut if the $28,000 support collapses, panic selling may ensue as stops of traders who have been accumulating above $31,000 may hit. The next support on the downside is $20,000.\\nETH/USDT\\nEther (ETH) rose above the 50-day simple moving average ($2,350) on July 7 but the bulls could not sustain the higher levels. That may have attracted profit-booking by short-term traders and shorting by aggressive bears.\\nETH/USDT daily chart.

If buyers thrust the price above the moving averages, the pair could rise to the downtrend line. A break above this level will be the first indication that the correction may be ending.\\nAlternatively, if the price turns down from the moving averages, the bears will again try to sink the pair below $2,000. If they succeed, the pair could drop to the next critical support at $1,728.74. This is an important support to watch out for because if it cracks, the bearish momentum may pick up and the decline could extend to $1,536.92.\\nBNB/USDT\\nThe relief rally in Binance Coin (BNB) hit a wall at the 50-day SMA ($231), which suggests that bears continue to sell at higher levels.

Moreover, the Playboy heritage NFT buyer will also get a framed limited-edition print of the water-skiing Playboy Bunny photo. The Playboy collection is being auctioned today and once a minimum reserve is met, it will trigger a 24-hour auction. The Playboy NFT auction coincides with Decentraland’s Art Week. “For the past 67 years, Playboy has provided a platform for artists, writers, and photographers to express themselves with total freedom,” the Miami Beach Collection description says. “From Pablo Picasso and Salvador Dalí to Keith Haring and Andy Warhol to Kinuko Kraft and LeRoy Neiman, Playboy has served as a creative incubator for some of the world’s most legendary artists long before they became household names.” “We’re honored to join the Superrare community, and so excited to present our first collaboration during Decentraland Art Week,” Rachel Webber, the chief brand officer at Playboy said in a statement. “We’ve long admired Superrare’s curatorial vision and are thrilled to continue Playboy’s legacy as a curator of artistic expression on the platform.

This figure represents a 17.3% jump from the 491 start-ups that were operating on the continent in 2019. Overall, the number of fintech start-ups in Africa has increased around 90% from the 2017 figure of 301. Nigerian Dominance Leading the charge in this continuing African fintech growth is the West Africa region where &#8220;Nigerian figures were up 42.6 percent on 2019.&#8221; In Ghana, fintech companies grew by 25% over the same period while Ivory Coast’s count was up 100%. However, as the study’s findings show, three countries — Nigeria, South Africa, and Kenya — totally dominate the continent’s fintech start-up space. For instance, the findings show that out of all the fintech start-ups that were tracked during the period between 2019 and 2021, 391 were located in these three countries. Of these 391 start-ups, 154 are based in South Africa, while Nigeria is not far behind with 144. Kenya is a distant third with 93 fintech start-ups. Covid-19 Induced Resurgence Meanwhile, study findings suggest that this resurgence of fintech growth in the &#8220;big three&#8221; markets could be linked to the Covid-19 related restrictions. For instance, the data shows that after the marginal drop of 2019, the proportion of payments and remittances fintech start-ups increased in these three countries. South African payment and remittances start-ups grew by 27.3%, a figure seven percentage points higher than its 2019 growth rate. In Kenya, the number of fintech start-ups increased by 21.5%, up from the 15.4% growth recorded in 2019. However, in Nigeria — which has consistently outperformed both South Africa and Kenya since 2017 — the number of payments and remittances-related fintech start-ups grew by 33.3%. This is only marginally higher than the 2019 growth rate of 32.7%. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); In terms of funds raised, the study findings show that Nigerian fintech start-ups have dominated since 2015. The study report explains: Of the 277 fintech funding rounds tracked by Disrupt Africa between 2015 and mid-2021, 108 of these rounds went to Nigerian startups, totalling $467,901,000 in investment and accounting for 53.4 per cent of funds raised since tracking began. This is a far higher total dollar amount than any other country in Africa. Meanwhile, South Africa, which is Nigeria’s nearest competitor, raised a total of $216,124,800 over the same period. However, this figure is only slightly higher than the total amount of Nigerian funding in 2021 so far, which is $208,225,000. Fintech Failures In addition to tracking new start-ups, the Disrupt Africa report also recorded the number of fintech failures. Explaining these start-up failures, the report reads: As noted previously, 109 of the fintech ventures featured in the 2019 edition of this report have since closed their doors. That represented 22.2 per cent of the 2019 total. Closures in and of themselves are obviously not positive things, but the countries and verticals in which most of these ‘fails’ have taken place suggest a market that is correcting itself. Interestingly, the Disrupt Africa study found that more fintech start-ups now have operations in more than one category. As the findings show, the continent had 143 multi-category fintechs operating in 2021, against the 73 that were seen in 2019. Leading in this category is Nigeria which has 39 followed by South Africa which has 31 while Kenya is not far behind with 30. What your thoughts on the findings of this study?

The Tesla chief also added that the company only sold about 10 per cent of holdings to confirm that bitcoin could be liquidated easily without moving market. While only in February Tesla revealed it had bought $1.5bn of bitcoin and that it would accept the cryptocurrency as a form of payment for cars, last month the company flipped its position and suspended vehicle purchases using the virtual tokens citing increasing use of fossil fuels for its mining. The bitcoin mining process to create new units of the virtual currency requires solving complex mathematical equations dependant on high levels of computer processing power. Teslas move, coupled with Chinas crackdown on cryptocurrency mining in the country, caused the prices of several virtual tokens including bitcoin to plummet . This is inaccurate. Tesla only sold ~10% of holdings to confirm BTC could be liquidated easily without moving market.

Story continues Cryptocurrency is a good idea on many levels and we believe it has a promising future, but this cannot come at great cost to the environment, Musk noted last month in a tweet.

He claimed that there is still maybe only two to three percent chance of the halving killing off the chain completely, but in his opinion, Bitcoin was being priced as if there was a zero percent chance of that happening. Also, he said that a big flash crash is more likely to happen:“I put at least a 10 percent chance on kind of a big flash crash”.It should be noted that Resnick and his team are big supporters of Bitcoin SV (BSV) and believe Craig Wright to be Satoshi Nakamoto.Network activity vindicates Resnick?Resnick’s argument for the death spiral went something like that. As the halving cuts the block reward, a large number of miners will leave the network. As the network hashrate drops, the block time increases, the network becomes congested. This, in turn, makes Bitcoin less attractive, as participants do not want to wait forever to have their transactions processed. This leads to the Bitcoin price falling, which pushes more miners off the grid. This process repeats itself until the network dies.Bitcoin transaction fees & block interval.

At the time of publication, there&#x2019;s around 100-115 exahash per second (EH/s) in search of bitcoin blocks and spectators have seen two relatively unknown mining pools join the top mining pool contenders. Both of these new mining pools capture around 14 EH/s today, and the top operations F2pool and BTC.com have around 34 EH/s between both pools. The last BTC halving saw a small amount of different network activity and every single mining operation lost 50% of revenue after the halving. A minuscule fraction of hashrate has left since the revenue cut, and BTC transaction (txn) fees have been on the rise. In the last 48 hours, a single BTC txn can cost a user between $2-4 depending on network congestion. Another noticeable sight is the occurrence of extremely less stealth hash (unknown miners) than weeks ago and two relatively new mining operations. The two mining pools called 1Thash and Lubian.com have gained a lot of hashrate since the halving and both operations have captured around 14 EH/s since then. Bitcoin hashrate distribution according to Btc.com&#x2019;s pool stats on May 14, 2020. The picture at the very bottom of this article is the top 15 mining pools hashing away at the Bitcoin (BTC) network. 1Thash was known for some time now, but the pool had way less hashpower than it does today, as it captures 7.6% of the overall hashrate on May 14, 2020. Hashrate distribution statistics show that the pool Lubian.com mined its first coins at block height 627,441. Similarly to 1Thash, the operation also has 7.6% of today&#x2019;s SHA256 hashrate on the BTC chain, and both of them control the fifth and sixth largest hashrate distribution positions. According to the regional reporter Lylian Teng from 8btc, Lubian&#x2019;s name means &#x201C;roadside&#x201D; and the website claims to be the &#x201C;safest high yielding mining pool.&#x201D; Teng also said that the local Chinese news outlet Blockbeats were the first to spot Lubian hashing away at the BTC chain, and they gave information to Btc.com for distribution statistics. BTC hashrate distribution on February 3, 2020, according to Blockchain.com&#x2019;s data. At the time there was more than 23% of stealth hash processing blocks on the BTC chain. BTC.com was the third largest and today it is the largest pool, and there were also far fewer pools during the first week of February 2020 as well. Blockchain.com&#x2019;s pool stat data still says &#x201C;unknown&#x201D; for Lubian&#x2019;s position, but Btc.com statistics has both Lubian and 1Thash recorded. If Btc.com&#x2019;s pool stats are correct, that would mean there is very little unknown hash stealth mining the BTC chain today. The data indicates that there are 15 known mining pools since the halving still hashing away. Pools include Btc.com, F2pool, Antpool, Poolin, 1Thash, Lubian, Viabtc, Huobi, Okex, Slush, Nova, Binance, Bitcoin.com, Spider, and Ukrpool.

So far, on Thursday three days after the halving, BTC&#x2019;s price has spiked to the $9,900 region. However, at that point, the value corrected some and the price has been hovering between the $9,500 to $9,750 zone since then. What do you think about the change in hashrate distribution since the reward halving?

Ver explained what he thinks about the central banks printing unlimited money, the government-induced lockdowns, and his opinions about certain cryptocurrencies like BTC, BCH, XRP, ETH, and more. Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver Discusses the Crypto Ecosystem on Digifinex Live On Thursday, Digifinex cofounder Kiana Shek during an AMA at 8 a.m. ET, asked Ver about the economic crisis and massive amounts if stimulus central banks have created during the last two months. Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver: The pandemic is a real disease and a real problem. But the reaction to it so far, seems to be much much worse than the disease itself. You see governments all over the world doing these economic stimulus packages. If printing money and just giving everybody some of it will make it so people never have to work again, why didn&#x2019;t we do that for the last 100 years? The fact of the matter is we need production, printing money, and giving people a bunch of checks doesn&#x2019;t do anything. That&#x2019;s not real economic progress. You actually have to have people building the businesses and building the goods and supplying the goods that people actually need in their lives. It&#x2019;s not going to take long to realize that if you pay everyone to stay home and not work we are going to start running out of the things people need. So if anything, the exact opposite needs to be done. We need to have people go back to work and start producing the things the world needs. Bitcoin.com Executive Chairman Roger Ver (left) and Digifinex cofounder, Kiana Shek. The Digifinex cofounder then asked Ver about his stance toward supporting Bitcoin Cash and why his position had changed. Roger Ver: To be clear, I didn&#x2019;t change anything and I&#x2019;ve been promoting the exact same thing for almost ten years now and that&#x2019;s peer-to-peer electronic cash for the entire world. And sadly what everyone is calling bitcoin (BTC) today, that project got hijacked. It&#x2019;s goal is no longer to be peer-to-peer cash for the world, which is the very title of the white paper. In fact, it got hijacked so badly that the people who run Bitcoin.org were talking about how to get rid of the white paper altogether because it was confusing people. Individuals who read the Bitcoin white paper and it&#x2019;s clearly not talking about what everyone is calling Bitcoin. The Bitcoin white paper is talking about something much closer to Bitcoin Cash. I am a fan of anything that works and puts people in charge of their own money. So they can send and receive money with anyone, anywhere, anytime without needing permission from anyone. Are you interested in reading the Bitcoin white paper? Check it out here.

One thing Vitalik has been writing a lot about lately is something called \"quadratic voting\" and \"quadratic funding.\" Normally, when you hold a vote for something, everyone gets one vote, and that vote is worth the same whether you care fervently about an issue or just flipped a coin to decide. Without going into detail, quadratic voting lets us measure the weight of how much a voter cares about an issue with more than two choices. It\\'s like ranked-choice voting, but even better.\\n\\nAnd quadratic funding is just donations using the sam...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nStephanie Hurder, a CoinDesk columnist, is a founding economist atPrysm Group, an economic advisory focused on the implementation of emerging technologies, and an academic contributor to the World Economic Forum. She has a PhD in Business Economics from Harvard.\n“I’ve read the plans to reopen the economy. They’re scary.”\nThat’s how Vox journalist Ezra Klein titled his piece reviewing four plans to transition the U.S. economy out of COVID-19 lockdown. Discussing the Herculean societal shifts required to implement contact tracing, which include requiring almost every American to download a geo-tracking app to their phone, he writes: “The technological and political obstacles are massive…Who is trusted enough, in this country in this moment, to shape this?”\nRelated:The Rise of ASICs: A Step-by-Step History of Bitcoin Mining\nCountries planning for the end of COVID-19 lockdowns face a host of daunting technological, government and public health challenges. One of these challenges is implementing a contact tracing system that doesn’t double as a dystopian surveillance tool. But there are more. How can governmentsquickly, credibly and transparently distribute government assistanceto individuals, especially the unbanked? How can companies enable adaptive supply chains for high-demand goods such as PPE and ventilators, including the potential for 3D printed goods? How can data be shared across independent organizations and entities, such as hospital groups, states and cities, that don’t normally collaborate? The list goes on and on.\nSee also:Stephanie Hurder – How Blockchain Tech Can Make Coronavirus Relief More Effective\nAs an economist advising permissionless and enterprise blockchain projects, I spend as much time explaining why DLT isnotuseful as why it is useful. What is stunning to me about the list of challenges above ishow many of them DLT could help to solve.\nDLT has an opportunity to add tremendous value to the United States at this time of huge societal and economic upheaval. To see why, it’s essential to understand the levers by which DLT and associated technologies, such as smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs, create value. At Prysm Group, we have developed a framework for DLT value creation we callthe 3 Cs, which I previously discussedhere:\n• Coordination:A shared ledger enables the use of a unified set of data across various companies and organizations. This reduces the costs of sharing and reconciling data, and enables insights derived from multiple data sources.\n• Commitment:Smart contracts and distributed consensus increase the credibility of agreements to take future actions and make payments. The cost of executing and enforcing contracts goes down.\n• Control:Distributed storage and zero-knowledge proofs allow data owners to selectively share their sensitive or personal data, making them more likely to participate in data sharing consortia.\nRelated:China’s National Blockchain Will Change the World\nCombined with tailored, use case-specific design choices, these are exactly the types of tools that can help solve major virus-driven problems.\nIn previous columns, my colleague Cathy Barrera and I have discussed how DLT can add value bycredibly implementing automatic stimulus paymentsandenabling marketplaces for 3D printed supplies. Consider now the case of contact tracing.\nSIMBA Chain, a DARPA-funded government contractor, is partnering with the Stanford Medicine Healthcare Innovation Lab and Prysm Group to develop an incentive-compatible, privacy-preserving solution that won’t require users to expose their personal data. The solution, which leverages zero-knowledge proof technology to enable privacy protection, retools a secure blockchain messaging systemdeveloped for the U.S. Department of Defenseand integrates adisease detection AI algorithmleveraging consumer wearables.\nThe ability to create projects from the ground up without relying entirely on governments, universities or large corporations has never been more important.\nAside from the technology itself, the decentralized governance structures established by the DLT community provide another path to address COVID-19 induced problems such as contact tracing and adaptive supply chain management as our standard institutions struggle. As the federal government stays paralyzed, universities are overwhelmed by the transition to online instruction,companies lay off hundreds of workers, and states and localities look tocreate their own ad-hoc governing coalitions, the ability to create projects from the ground up without relying entirely on governments, universities or large corporations has never been more important.\nDLT projects will need to engage in smart economic design to deliver solutions to problems of this magnitude. In order to gain adoption and have real, positive impact, those projects should consider the following:\nThe Verge tech journalist Casey Newton says adoption rates for even the most successful contact tracing applicationshave been universally low.Even the best technologies – especially contact tracing solutions – are of little use if no one will use them. Understanding how individuals make the choice of whether or not to adopt a technology, and how to incentivize them to adopt these new solutions using both monetary and non-monetary levers, is essential for any large-scale program.\nDesigning effective incentives requires a deep understanding of how people will use (and potentially misuse) products, and expert knowledge of the systems and environments in which the product will operate. This understanding cannot develop in a bubble; it requires ongoing communication with users and subject-matter experts. Public health, law and economics insights will be essential to incorporate throughout the development process.\nDLT-based projects exhibitnetwork effects: their value grows as more users join. Projects that are developed in response to the current crisis may initially need to be funded with public money, but can evolve to be fiscally self-sustaining in the long run. Platform development teams should focus on bootstrapping early, building a robust user base, and then shift to monetization and profitability as the economic value delivered increases.\nSee more:COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work. That’s a Big Ask\nFor example, if the privacy-preserving contact tracing system discussed above is adopted widely, this could lead to significantly reduced costs for insurance companies, who would face huge fiscal challenges if millions of people become infected with COVID-19 and require intensive medical care. While the willingness to invest upfront to launch such a project may be low due to the substantial uncertainty in the current environment, in the long term health care payers could have significant willingness to pay to sustain such a service. A product offering like this could be a valuable addition to existing large blockchain consortia already working in healthcare, such as the Health Utility Network or Synaptic Health Alliance.\nThe challenges presented by COVID-19 require drastic and creative solutions. Blockchain and DLT have the right features to address some of the biggest obstacles to overcoming these challenges. If groups currently building with these technologies rise to the occasion using the right economic approach, DLT has the potential to shift from a niche technology to mainstream contribution.\n• COVID-19 Tracing Apps Have to Go Viral to Work.

However, just because the stocks are cheap doesn’t you you shouldn’t be wary of bad investments. It’s unlikely that purely speculative names will be among the millionaire-maker penny stocks. The focus must be on undervalued penny stocks that represent good businesses. Further, there will be impending industry or company specific catalysts that need to be clearly identified. The risk here is that if these catalysts don’t play out, the stock returns will be subdued or negative. However, if the catalyst is triggered, 10x or 20x returns will not out of the question. The bottom-line: Invest what you can afford to lose in these undervalued millionaire-maker penny stocks. I am, however, optimistic that the stocks discussed represent companies where there is a high probability of the catalyst being triggered. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Let’s discuss three undervalued penny stocks and the specific factors that may spell stellar returns. Cronos (CRON) A marijuana leaf rests on top of little tins filled with a balm. Source: Shutterstock The big impending catalyst for the cannabis industry is federal-level legalization. If this scenario holds true, Cronos (NASDAQ: CRON ) will skyrocket, and I expect at least 10x returns in quick time. Even without federal level legalization, CRON is a deeply undervalued stock. As of Q2 2023, Cronos reported cash and equivalents of $841 million . The company’s cash buffer is higher than the current market valuation. Cronos intends to use the cash for aggressive expansion in the United States on federal-level legalization. At the same time, the cash will be utilized towards research and development to broaden the product portfolio. It’s also worth noting that Cronos has pursued cost-cutting initiatives. This includes the decision to exit the U.S. hemp business. The company expects to end the current financial year with the cash position swelling further. Being successful in arresting the cash burn is a major positive that will impact valuations. Solid Power (SLDP) Smartphone with logo of American battery company Solid Power Inc. on screen in front of business website. Focus on center-left of phone display. Source: T. Schneider / Shutterstock.com For Solid Power (NASDAQ: SLDP ) stock, multibagger returns depend on the company’s ability to commercialize solid-state batteries. If the company is successful in its research and development initiatives, 10x or 20x returns would not be surprising. I strongly believe that Solid Power is one of the best bets in the solid-state battery segment. Of course, commercialization is still a few years away. However, Solid Power seems to be making the right moves. Story continues One reason to be bullish is the fact that Solid Power has strong automotive partners. This includes Ford (NYSE: F ) and BMW (OTCMKTS: BMWYY ). In December, the company licensed its cell design and manufacturing process to BMW. The idea is to pursue parallel research and development. Solid Power will also be delivering EV battery cells to automotive partners in 2023 for validation testing. Potential approval of solid-state batteries by automotive majors can be a big catalyst for stock upside. Bitfarms (BITF) A Bitcoin (BTC) token in front of the Bitfinex logo. Source: Useacoin / Shutterstock.com For year-to-date 2023, Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has trended higher by 77%. For the same period, Bitfarms (NASDAQ: BITF ) stock has skyrocketed by 258%. This puts into perspective the upside potential for this Bitcoin miner. Furthermord, the basic assumption for BITF stock being a multibagger is a continued rally in Bitcoin. It’s important to note that Bitcoin halving is due in 2024, and a big upside might be impending. Standard Chartered believes that Bitcoin will quadruple by the end of 2024 . If this scenario holds true, BITF stock will skyrocket. Specific to Bitfarms, there are two reasons to be bullish. First, the company has been adding mining capacity on a sustained basis. As of July, mining capacity was 5.3EH/s . Further, Bitfarms expects to have zero debt in its balance sheet by February 2024. Additionally, the company reported a liquidity buffer of $48 million as of Q2 2023. With high financial flexibility, the company is positioned for aggressive expansion. This will translate into robust revenue growth and cash flow upside.

That's the highest single-day notional volume in three months. Deribit accounted for over 80% of the global tally.\n\"We have seen the biggest trading volume in three months. There is a lot of interest in buying call options,\" Deribit's Asia business development personnel Lin Chen told CoinDesk.\nOptions give investors the right to buy or sell the underlying asset, in this case, bitcoin, at a set price at a later date. A call option buyer gets the right to buy and a put buyer gets the right to sell. Traders often buy calls as a low-cost leveraged bullish bet.\nCall options at strike prices of $30,000, $31,000, $32,000 and $40,000 have been popular among traders in the past 24 hours, per Laevitas.\nIn the past seven days, call spreads have accounted for 45% of the total block flows. Block trades are large orders executed on over-the-counter liquidity networks like Paradigm and then listed on exchanges.\nAccording to Patrick Chu, director of institutional sales and trading at Paradigm, the price rally has forced some call overwriters to buy back the bullish exposure. Call overwriting involves selling calls against the cryptocurrency owned and is a popular strategy for generating additional yield in a flat-to-negative market.\n\"Mostly, people have been buying back the topside, especially option overwriters given the rapid upward move,\" Chu said.\nThe increased demand for options pushed Deribit's bitcoin volatility index, DVOL, to 59.24, the highest since early April, per Amberdata.\nThe DVOL measures bitcoin's 30-day implied volatility (IV) calculated using Deribit's options order book. The higher the demand for options, the higher the IV and vice versa. The IV refers to investors' expectations for price turbulence over a specific period.\n\"The increased demand for options has pushed up the DVOL,\" Deribit's Chen said.\nImplied volatility usually rises during risk aversion in traditional markets. Deribit's DVOL, however, tends to rise when prices rise, Chen explained.\nBitcoin's implied volatility and spot prices have been positively correlated since the start of the year.\n\"The DVOL is moving reactively on the recent headlines and the last three days' spot move. Prices were very contained in the recent two months and realized volatility has been low overall. The market was caught a bit short [volatility] going in and people are scrambling to cover,\" Chu noted.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":29077.38,\"take_profit\":29781.81,\"forecast_10d\":[29415.96, 29282.91, 29408.44, 29170.35, 28701.78, 26664.55, 26049.56, 26096.21, 26189.58, 26124.14]}"}

One most don't think about is Apache Corporation (NYSE: APA) . That's natural: Independent oil and gas exploration and production companies don't exactly need to advertise to the public, since your average consumer doesn't have much need for a barrel of unrefined crude oil or a thousand cubic feet of natural gas. But what really shocks me is how few investors are talking about Apache, which not only looks like one of the best buys in the oil patch right now but has major growth potential. Here's why you should be thinking about Apache, even if nobody's talking about it. Small oil drums, a pool of black liquid, coins and currency bills, a paper with graphs, and a pen sit on a wooden surface. Although the stock market hasn't rewarded Apache, the oil and gas driller seems like a top candidate for outperformance. Image source: Getty Images. A screaming bargain In August 2016, in the depths of the oil price slump, the stock market was valuing Apache at just under $20 billion. At the time, Apache had major operations in the North Sea and Egypt, plus some lower-margin North American assets, including Canadian tar sands projects. But in September, Apache made a major announcement: It had been quietly picking up acreage in an area of West Texas called the Delaware Basin -- a subset of the large Permian Basin shale formation. Because nobody expected much oil or gas in the region, Apache had been able to grab some 300,000 acres at a bargain price of just $1,300 per acre. The company had done extensive testing in the region and stunned the energy world with its findings. Far from being empty of oil and gas, Apache's initial testing indicated that there were at least 3 billion barrels of oil and 75 trillion cubic feet of natural gas underneath its play. Almost overnight, Apache's market cap soared to about $24 billion. Land prices in the region shot up as well, with companies paying between $30,000 and $40,000 per acre to get in on the action. Story continues But ironically, Apache's share price -- along with its market cap -- has trended lower since then, even as the company confirmed the existence of more and more oil and gas in the play. Today, the company has a market cap of about $17 billion... less than it did before the West Texas play -- dubbed Alpine High -- was announced. Here's why that seems completely crazy. It doesn't add up As I mentioned, Apache owns about 300,000 acres at Alpine High, and adjacent land has been selling for $30,000 per acre to $40,000 per acre. Let's use the more conservative $30,000 figure. That puts an approximate sale value for Alpine High of $9 billion...just for the land alone. In other words, it's worth more than half of Apache's market cap. But remember, those sale prices were for undeveloped land, and since its big announcement in 2016, Apache has been devoting a lot of capital to building out the oil and gas infrastructure in the region. By the time 2018 is done, Apache will have spent nearly $1 billion in capital on Alpine High infrastructure. That increases Alpine High's value; even if we say that the capital expenditures are worth half of what Apache paid for them, it implies a market value of about $9.5 billion for Alpine High. Apache has made other changes to its operations since the Alpine High announcement, notably selling off its underperforming Canadian assets to focus on the Permian Basin. But if Alpine High -- again, just the 300,000 acres of land and existing midstream infrastructure alone -- is worth about $9.5 billion, then that means the market is assigning a value of just $7.5 billion to the entire rest of the company, including its profitable overseas operations, its exploration blocks in Suriname -- which are adjacent to ExxonMobil's and Hess's massive finds in the region -- and the other 2.5 million acres of Apache's Permian Basin holdings. From a value perspective, Apache looks incredibly cheap. Leaps and bounds Of course, Apache isn't going to sell Alpine High: it's going to continue to produce oil and gas from the play. A lot of oil and gas. In fact, Apache is projecting its overall Permian operations -- including Alpine High -- will be generating at least 315,000 barrel of oil equivalents per day (BOE/d) by 2020, about double the 158,000 barrels it produced in 2017. That will help boost companywide production to an estimated 475,000 BOE/d to 510,000 BOE/d, up from 350,000 BOE/d last year, a double-digit compounded annual growth rate (CAGR). At Alpine High, the company is projecting a production CAGR of more than 150% through 2020! So why isn't the market taking notice? One concern might be that Permian Basin production is ramping up so quickly that it might soon outstrip transportation capacity. Apache, though, is on top of the problem, recently announcing it would form a new $3.5 billion publicly traded midstream corporation with Kayne Anderson Acquisition Corp. that will be called Altus Midstream. Apache will own about 71% of Altus. Through Altus, Apache is investing in Kinder Morgan 's Permian Highway pipeline, which will transport up to 2 billion cubic feet of natural gas per day from the Permian Basin to refining facilities on the Gulf Coast. Apache is also signed on as one of the primary shippers of product through the pipeline (along with ExxonMobil). Apache's management has been very effective at deploying its capital, to the point that its return on capital employed is the highest in its peer group and even bests ExxonMobil's. These investments in future production growth and transportation should keep the company well positioned for the future. Why Apache deserves some attention There are some risks to investing in Apache, of course. If oil prices drop suddenly, like they did in 2014, increased production might not be enough to keep the wolf from the door. But of course, that's a risk for the entire industry, not just Apache. Perhaps the bigger risk is that the market will continue to inexplicably ignore Apache regardless of its performance. But Apache's excellent value and strong production projections should make the market stand up and take notice. Everyone should be talking about Apache. However, until they do, investors in the know can pick up these shares at a price that looks like an incredible bargain.

Geopolitics continued to weigh on riskier assets, with the markets in the hands of news updates on Russia and the Ukraine. Following a 7.6% slide on Thursday, Bitcoin fell by 1.36% to end the day at $39,995. Amidst a broad-based crypto sell-off, Bitcoin ended the day at sub-$40,000 for the first time since 3rd February. Resistance at $40,000 pegged Bitcoin back late in the day. It was a mixed session for the rest of the crypto top 10, however. Avalanche ( AVAX ) slid by 5.27% to lead the way down, with Solana ( SOL ) and Cardano (ADA) falling by 3.92% and by 2.45% respectively. Ethereum ( ETH ) ended the day down by 3.92%. Terra ( LUNA ) avoided the red, rising by 0.42%, however, with Ripple ( XRP ) ending the day up by 2.29%. NASDAQ 100 Tests Bitcoin Support Following Thursday’s 2.88% slide, the NASDAQ 100 fell by 1.23% on Friday. Market reaction to news of an imminent Russian invasion of the Ukraine continued to weigh on riskier assets. With the U.S markets closed for the weekend, news updates on Russia and the Ukraine will remain key for the day ahead. Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index Continues Upswing Following Friday’s slide back to 30/100 and deep into the Fear zone, the Bitcoin Fear & Greed Index fell to 25/100 and into the “Extreme Fear” zone this morning. Geopolitics and increased regulatory chatter remain key drivers near-term. For the Bitcoin bulls, the Index will need to move back through last week’s 54/100 high to bring $50,000 levels back into play for Bitcoin. A fall back through to sub-20/100 would bring sub-$30,000 levels back into play. Bitcoin Price Action At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.22% to $40,000. A move through the day’s $40,189 pivot would support a run at Friday’s high $40,981. Bitcoin would need plenty of support to break out from the first major resistance level at $40,881. In the event of an extended rally, Bitcoin could test the third major resistance level at $43,157 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $41,673. Story continues Failure to move through the pivot would bring the first major support level at $39,397 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, however, Bitcoin should avoid sub-$38,000 levels. The second major support level at $38,705 should limit the downside. Looking at the EMAs and 4-hourly candlesticks (below), the signal has become more bearish. Bitcoin continues to sit well below 50-day EMA, which has narrowed on the 100-day and 200-day EMAs overnight. The current sell-off has also seen the 100-day EMA converge on the 200-day EMA. A bearish cross of the 100-day EMA through the 200-day EMA would deliver another loss. A bearish cross of the 50-day EMA through the 100-day and 200-day EMAs would be particularly bearish. For the bulls, a Bitcoin move back through the 200-day EMA, currently at $41,900, would provide some support.

Bullish sentiment appears to be low despite bitcoin marking its 13th birthday . On Jan. 3, 2009, Satoshi Nakamoto mined the first block, the Genesis Block, which marked the beginning of the Bitcoin blockchain. For now, technical indicators suggest nearby support could encourage short-term buying activity. Still, long-term momentum has slowed, which could point to low or negative crypto returns this month. Some analysts are monitoring blockchain data for clues on BTC’s future price direction. For example, net exchange flows have increased recently, signaling a bearish shift in investor sentiment similar to the one seen before the price crash last May. Other metrics, however, show improvements that could boost overall market sentiment. The Bitcoin blockchain’s hashrate set new highs on Sunday night after crossing previous highs from mid-2021. Hashrate refers to the amount of computational power used by miners dedicated to the minting of new bitcoins and verification of new transactions on the Bitcoin network.

In previous cycles, an initial burst of activity supported rallying prices, but recently, transactions failed to sustain any meaningful momentum, according to crypto data firm Glassnode. “Until there is further expansion in demand for Bitcoin block space, it can be reasonably expected that price action will be somewhat uneventful, and likely sideways at a macro scale,” Glassnode wrote in a blog post on Monday.

Genesis stated on Nov. 16 that it would “temporarily suspend redemptions and new loan originations in the lending business.”\\xa0After causing initial mayhem in the markets, the firm refuted speculation of “imminent” bankruptcy on Nov. 22, although it confirmed difficulties in raising money. More importantly, Genesis’ parent company Digital Currency Group (DCG) owns Grayscale — the asset manager behind Grayscale Bitcoin Trust, which holds some 633,360 BTC. Contagion risks from the FTX-Alameda Research implosion continue to exert negative pressure on the markets, but the industry is working to improve transparency and insolvency risks. For example, on Nov. 24, crypto derivatives exchange Bybit launched a $100 million fund to help market makers and high-frequency trading institutions struggling with financial or operational difficulties.More recently, on Nov. 25, Binance published a Merkle Tree-backed proof of funds for its Bitcoin deposits. Moreover, the exchange outlined how users can use the mechanism to verify their holdings. There’s no doubt that centralized institutions must embrace transparency and insurance mechanisms to regain investors’ trust. First, however, one must analyze Bitcoin derivatives markets to fully understand how professional traders are digesting such news.Futures market discount improved slightly but remains far from bullishFixed-month futures contracts usually trade at a slight premium to regular spot markets because sellers demand more money to withhold settlement for longer. Technically known as contango, this situation is not exclusive to crypto assets.In healthy markets, futures should trade at a 4% to 8% annualized premium, which is enough to compensate for the risks plus the cost of capital. The opposite, when the demand for bearish bets is exceptionally high, causes a discount on futures markets — known as backwardation.Bitcoin 2-month futures annualized premium. Source: Laevitas.chConsidering the data above, it becomes evident that derivatives traders flipped bearish on Nov. 9, as the Bitcoin futures premium flipped negative. Yet, according to futures markets, the $15,500 dip on Nov. 21 was not enough to instill additional demand for leveraged short positions. Option markets confirm the bearishnessTraders should analyze options markets to understand whether Bitcoin will likely retest the $15,500 support. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers are overcharging for upside or downside protection.The indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.In a nutshell, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.Bitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: LaevitasAs displayed above, the 25% delta skew has been above the 10% threshold since Nov. 9, indicating options traders are pricing a higher risk of unexpected price dumps.

The former was placed on the central bank&#8217;s Investor Alert List (IAL) while the latter was not. The regulator clarified: While both Binance and FTX are not licensed here, there is a clear difference between the two: Binance was actively soliciting users in Singapore while FTX was not. The MAS ordered Binance to cease providing payment services to Singapore residents in September last year. A few months later, the crypto exchange shut down its exchange services in the city-state. &#8220;Binance in fact went to the extent of offering listings in Singapore dollars and accepted Singapore-specific payment modes such as Paynow and Paylah,&#8221; the central bank stressed, adding that it received several complaints about Binance between January and August 2021. The MAS detailed: MAS placed Binance on the IAL because it had solicited Singapore users without a licence. Further, on MAS’ referral, the Commercial Affairs Department commenced investigation into Binance for possible contravention of the Payment Services Act (PS Act). There was no reason to place FTX on the IAL as there was no evidence that it had contravened the PS Act. Commenting on FTX specifically, the regulator noted: &#8220;There was no evidence that it was soliciting Singapore users specifically. Trades on FTX also could not be transacted in Singapore dollars. But as in the case of thousands of other financial and crypto entities that operate overseas, Singapore users were able to access FTX services online.&#8221; A recent study indicated that when Binance shut down services in Singapore, its users switched to FTX.

Furthermore, the MAS emphasized: &#8220;Cryptocurrencies themselves are highly volatile and many of them have lost all value &#8230; The ongoing turmoil in the crypto industry serves as a reminder of the huge risks of dealing in cryptocurrencies.&#8221; Following the meltdown of FTX, Singapore government&#8217;s Temasek wrote down its $275 million investment in the crypto company.

The 10,000 bitcoins in question, worth over $165 million, have been transferred to new addresses in several transactions. Bitcoin Stored in Dormant Wex Wallet Moves for the First Time in Five Years The unknown holder of a bitcoin wallet linked to the now-defunct Wex, once the largest cryptocurrency exchange in the Russian-speaking market, has withdrawn 10,000 coins. Funds at this BTC address last moved in September 2017, when the same amount was sent out. Wex was established in that year, following the collapse of BTC-e, which closed down after the arrest in Greece of one of its operators, Alexander Vinnik. The Russian IT specialist, who is currently in U.S. custody, is accused of laundering up to $9 billion through the exchange. The transfer of the digital money was first noticed by Sergey Mendeleev, founder of cryptocurrency exchange Garantex and CEO of defi banking platform Indefibank. He revealed the discovery on his Telegram channel, according to a report by the leading Russian crypto news outlet Bits.media. The coins moved on Wednesday, Nov. 23. Several transactions were made, including two likely test transfers of small amounts, before the 10,000 BTC was sent. 3,500 BTC was transferred to one address and 6,500 BTC went to another, likely a change address. The value of the withdrawn cryptocurrency, at the time of writing, exceeds $165 million in fiat equivalent. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): [['u/nimarama72', \"Who's in Bitcoin for the tech..?\", 122, '2022-11-25 00:07', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z3xd5m/whos_in_bitcoin_for_the_tech/', \"Who's in it for the tech..?\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z3xd5m/whos_in_bitcoin_for_the_tech/', 'z3xd5m', [['u/Mr_P_Nissaurus', 183, '2022-11-25 00:27', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/z3xd5m/whos_in_bitcoin_for_the_tech/ixo5r8l/', 'I\\'m in it for:  \\n1.

Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Although Bitcoin and select altcoins are trying to start a relief rally, the overall trend remains bearish. Therefore, short-term traders who buy for a pullback should consider booking profits or tightening their stops when the price struggles to break above stiff resistance levels. The strategy may be different for long-term investors who may use the dips to strong support levels to acquire the cryptocurrencies of their choice. It is prudent to adopt a staggered buying approach as a runaway rally is unlikely. Let’s look at the top five cryptocurrencies that are trying to start a recovery in the short term.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin turned up sharply on June 15, trapping the aggressive bears who may have gone short on a break below $25,250. That may have caused a short squeeze in the near term, which propelled the price to the 20-day exponential moving average ($26,403).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe bears are trying to limit the relief rally at the 20-day EMA but a positive sign is that the bulls have not given up much ground. This suggests that the buyers are holding on to their positions in anticipation of a move higher.However, the bears are likely to have other plans as they will try to offer stiff resistance in the zone between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the descending channel. If the price turns down from this zone, the BTC/USDT pair may remain inside the channel for a while longer.But if bulls drive the price above the channel, the pair will signal a potential trend change in the near term. The pair could then surge toward $31,000.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-EMA on the four-hour chart has turned up and the relative strength index (RSI) is in the positive area, indicating that bulls have the upper hand in the near term. There is a minor resistance at $26,850, but if that is crossed, the pair may reach the resistance line of the channel near $27,600. This level may prove to be a difficult hurdle for the bulls to cross, but if they manage to do that, the pair could rally to $28,500.This positive view will invalidate in the short term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-EMA. That could pull the price down to the 50-simple moving average and eventually to the strong support zone between $25,250 and $24,800. A break below this zone may intensify selling.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) has been in the thick of things for the past few days, but a positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to break the $220 support. This indicates demands at lower levels.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe first resistance on the upside is the 38.2% Fibonacci retracement level of $252.50. If this level is scaled, the BNB/USDT pair may reach the 20-day EMA ($261). The bears will try to halt the recovery at this level. If they succeed, the pair may turn down toward $220.On the contrary, if bulls propel the price above the 20-day EMA, the pair could reach the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $272.50. This is a crucial level for the bears to defend because if it gives way, the pair may soar toward $305.BNB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe four-hour chart shows that the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover, and the RSI has risen into the positive zone. This indicates that buyers are attempting a comeback. The bulls will have to overcome the barrier at $252.50 to gain strength. The pair could then rally to $265.On the downside, the first support is at the 20-EMA. If this level breaks down, the pair could slip to the uptrend line. A break and close below this level will indicate that the bulls have given up. The pair could then retest the critical support at $220.Litecoin price analysisLitecoin (LTC) plunged below the symmetrical triangle pattern on June 10, indicating that bears have the upper hand. The sellers pulled the price below the immediate support at $75 on June 14 but could not build upon this move. LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe sharp recovery in the past few days has pushed the LTC/USDT pair back above $75. This shows strong buying at lower levels. The bulls will next try to push the price to the 20-day EMA ($82), which is an important level to keep an eye on. If buyers clear this hurdle, the pair may rise to the 50-day SMA ($86).Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down from the current level or the 20-day EMA and breaks below $70, it will signal the start of the downtrend. The first stop is likely to be $65 and then $60.LTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe strong recovery pushed the price above the 20-EMA on the 4-hour chart, suggesting that the selling pressure is reducing. The moving averages are on the verge of completing a bullish crossover and the RSI has jumped into the positive territory, indicating that buyers are attempting a comeback.There is a minor resistance at $80 but if bulls overcome this obstacle, the pair may accelerate to $85 and thereafter to $90.

A minor positive for the bulls is that they successfully defended the support at $30.50, indicating demand at lower levels.OKB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price has reached the 20-day EMA ($42.73), which is an important level to watch out for. If the price turns down from the current level, it will suggest that the sentiment remains negative and traders are selling on rallies. That could pose a serious threat to the $38.50 support. If this level gives way, the OKB/USDT pair may skid to $35 and eventually to $30.Contrarily, if buyers thrust the price above the 20-day EMA, it will suggest that the bears may be losing their grip. The pair could then rise to the support line, which is likely to act as a formidable resistance. Buyers will have to kick the price above $48 to gain the upper hand.OKB/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe pair bounced off $38.50 with vigor but is facing resistance near $42.39. A minor positive in favor of the buyers is that the moving averages have completed a bullish crossover and the RSI is in the positive territory.If buyers thrust the price above $42.39, the pair may pick up momentum and soar to $46 where the bears are again expected to mount a strong defense. Another possibility is that the price turns down and tumbles below the 20-EMA. That may indicate a possible range-bound action between $38.50 and $42.39 for some time.Quant price analysisQuant (QNT) rebounded off the $95 level with strength on June 16, indicating aggressive buying at the support. QNT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, the bears have not yet given up and they are fiercely defending the downtrend line. Sellers will try to sink the price below $95 while the bulls will try to maintain the QNT/USDT pair above it. If the price turns up from $95 once again, it will enhance the prospects of a rally above the downtrend line. If that happens, the pair may start a strong recovery that could catapult the price to $135.This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price continues lower and plummets below $95. The pair may then slip to $87 and subsequently to $80.QNT/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe four-hour chart shows that the pair quickly gave back a major portion of its gains, indicating that bears are active at higher levels. They pulled the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $103.90, which is a negative sign. Buyers will have to quickly drive the price back above the moving averages if they want to have another shot at the downtrend line. Alternatively, if the price sustains below the 50-SMA, the likelihood of a drop to $95 increases.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Goldman Sachs Expects U.S. Inflation to Decline Slower Than Market Anticipates Goldman Sachs’ strategists, led by chief interest rates strategist Praveen Korapaty, warned in a note Friday that inflation in the U.S. is projected to decrease at a slower pace than what is currently being priced by the markets, Bloomberg reported. The Goldman strategists explained that investors may be assuming that a sharp slowdown in economic growth would result in a more rapid decline in inflation. Moreover, they could also be more bearish about energy prices compared to what is implied by commodity futures. However, the strategists argued that these factors will have a limited impact on inflation, emphasizing that markets are additionally ignoring the potential for &#8220;delayed-onset inflation&#8221; in sectors like healthcare. They wrote: Although we expect further declines in inflation going forward, markets appear considerably more optimistic than we are about the pace of cooling. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); The Federal Reserve paused raising interest rates after 10 consecutive rate hikes at their Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting last week. Their decision followed the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) reporting that inflation had cooled from 4.9% to 4% in May — the smallest 12-month increase since March 2021. However, core inflation remains elevated at 5.3%. While many people expect the Federal Reserve to start cutting interest rates soon, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said at a press conference Wednesday that while “it will be appropriate to cut rates at a time when inflation is coming down really significantly, we’re talking about a couple years out.” Do you agree with Goldman Sachs about inflation in the U.S.?

The global investment bank cited the historical experience of when the U.S. overtook Great Britain as the world&#8217;s largest economy. JPMorgan Discusses Future of U.S. Dollar Amid China&#8217;s Projected Economic Dominance Global investment bank JPMorgan’s strategists recently discussed the potential impact on the U.S. dollar in the event that the Chinese economy surpasses the U.S. as the world&#8217;s largest economy. According to the Centre for Economics and Business Research (CEBR), one of the U.K.&#8217;s leading economics consultancies, China is projected to surpass the United States as the world&#8217;s largest economy by 2030. The JPMorgan strategists explained that even if China surpasses the U.S. economy, the USD is unlikely to lose its status as the world&#8217;s reserve currency immediately, citing historical experience suggesting that any transition would be gradual. &#8220;While the U.S. surpassed Great Britain as the world&#8217;s largest economy in the latter part of the 19th century, the U.S. dollar is commonly perceived to have overtaken the British pound as the world&#8217;s foremost reserve currency only by the end of WWII,&#8221; the JPMorgan strategists wrote, adding: Historical experience thus suggests that if China were to overtake the U.S. as the world&#8217;s largest economy around 2030, dollar dominance may persist even into the second half of the 21st century. According to JPMorgan, China is the only country that could replace the dollar and the U.S. economy in the long term. However, the global investment bank&#8217;s strategists believe that this is unlikely to happen, given the US&#8217; economic, technological, demographic, and geographic advantages. Furthermore, the Chinese yuan&#8217;s potential for growth is contingent on China easing capital controls. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Nonetheless, the JPMorgan strategists reiterated the possibility of gradual de-dollarization, stating that the process could be expedited by either diminishing confidence in the U.S. dollar or positive developments outside the U.S. that boost the credibility of an alternative currency. A potential alternative to the USD is the proposed common BRICS currency. The BRICS nations comprise Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa. Some people believe that the Chinese yuan will replace the USD as the world&#8217;s reserve currency. The chairman of Russia&#8217;s second-largest bank, for example, expects the yuan to replace the USD as the world&#8217;s main reserve and settlement currency &#8220;as early as the next decade.&#8221; A senior economist at financial services firm TD recently stated that the largest challengers to the dollar today are the euro and the Chinese renminbi. Economist Stephen Jen, a former Morgan Stanley managing director, expects a shift “from a unipolar reserve currency world to a multipolar world,” with the Chinese yuan, the euro, and the U.S. dollar forming a “tripolar” reserve currency configuration. Do you think the Chinese yuan will replace the U.S. dollar as the world&#8217;s reserve currency?

Ethscriptions, as described on the online platform ethscriptions.com, is a &#x201C;new way of creating and sharing digital artifacts on Ethereum using transaction calldata.&#x201D; From Bitcoin to Ethereum: Ethscriptions Take Center Stage in Crypto Community This weekend crypto enthusiasts have been discussing a new technology that is similar to Bitcoin&#x2019;s Ordinal inscriptions except this idea leverages the Ethereum blockchain. The new concept is called Ethscriptions and it was created by the co-founder of the Capsule 21 podcast Tom Lehman. The Ethscriptions creator is also the co-founder and former CEO of genius.com. Let\\'s take a moment to appreciate that after 6 years of stagnation on Bitcoin where other chains did all of the innovation, Ethereum is now copying the innovation happening on Bitcoin. Bitcoin is back. pic.twitter.com/6CmzEB6xuB &#x2014; Leonidas.og (@LeonidasNFT) June 18, 2023 The creator showed off the new technology during a Twitter Spaces event held on June 16, 2023. Middlemarch wrote a thread about the concept on the same day while also introducing a collection called &#x201C;Ethereum Punks.&#x201D; Ethscriptions are created on Ethereum through successful transactions with unique data URIs. &#x201C;Duplicate content is ignored,&#x201D; Lehman detailed and &#x201C;all valid mimetypes are supported.&#x201D; To ensure uniqueness, no previous Ethscription in a block or in the same transaction block can have the same content. Ethscription transfers occur when a transaction&#x2019;s input data is the hash of a valid Ethscription, and the transaction&#x2019;s sender is the Ethscription&#x2019;s owner. A file used for an inscription on the ETH chain must be under the 96-kilobyte threshold. &#x201C;The recipient of the creation transaction is the Ethscription&#x2019;s initial owner. The sender of the creation transaction is the Ethscription&#x2019;s creator,&#x201D; the Ethscription creator said. Lehman has also launched a website called ethscriptions.com, which enables visitors to view all the Ethscriptions or browse them by address. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', ...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): [['u/RuneW007', 'How and when did you first hear about Bitcoin?', 31, '2023-06-18 00:18', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/14c3hgk/how_and_when_did_you_first_hear_about_bitcoin/', 'My very first time hearing about Bitcoin was late 2016 when Btc was around 700$ a coin.

From San Salvador to Santa Ana to El Zonte, everywhere you could see the national project changing the physical landscape, and sense the palpable excitement and connection of the people to the vibrant pulse of a nation truly reborn. ‘Don’t trust, verify,’ we bitcoiners like to say. To my very own surprise, the facts on the ground not only lived up to the hype, they exceeded it.\\n\\n**1. Pupusas and Pilsener**\\n\\nTraveling on a tight schedule, our only night in San Salvador seemed like a lost cause due to the 6-hour delay of our flight from Honduras. With the sun getting quite low on the horizon by the time we landed, our expectations to behold the cathedral and public square of the Centro Historico in their full glory were mostly dashed. Thankfully, we went anyways.\\n\\nAfter strolling around late into the night, and working up quite the appetite, Google Maps indicated that “San Jose” was the only pupuseria still open nearby. The place was very unassuming, a ‘hole in the wall’ type of establishment. Workers finishing their long day shifted in and out, getting a quick bite before going home for the night.\\n\\n[Pupuseria San Jose](https://preview.redd.it/kxtilfe9uo6b1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=49afe3dd7002bf3a3f2ec2f1ef4f9199d5a38a1c)\\n\\nInside, neon lights bounced off the bright orange cement walls, and in the front, next to the grill where a young woman churned out pupusas by the dozen, a big purple Chivo sign read “Se aceptan pagos con Bitcoin.” I am not one to believe in omens, but when the universe gifts you purple and orange at the people’s pupuseria of choice, the classy thing to do is to acknowledge, and enjoy.\\n\\nAfter getting our order, we made our way to the long wooden benches that lined the walls on each side, and sat among the jars of pickled cabbage decorating the rows of cheap plastic tables. As we wolfed down the pupusas and drank our Pilsener beers, a voice beamed down from the TV hanging by the ceiling menu: “He arrived at the presidency in debt, with his investments in the gutter, and this person left the presidency as a millionaire...”\\n\\n[Wall Menu](https://preview.redd.it/j8q1nncbuo6b1.jpg?width=3972&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=3383215e8d6334b8bf56dd1a0d641069e5a760a5)\\n\\nIt was Attorney General Rodolfo Antonio Delgado Montes, [talking to the press](https://www.youtube.com/live/XU70xL2UeNg?feature=share) after [confiscating the properties](https://larepublica.pe/mundo/2023/06/02/el-salvador-alfredo-cristiani-nayib-bukele-anuncia-la-intervencion-de-las-propiedades-del-expresidente-cristiani-felix-cristiani-caso-gabela-98922) of [Alfredo Cristiani](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alfredo_Cristiani), former president and surrogate for Monsanto in Central America. Far from being another sanitized news segment, the AG spoke candidly and at length, seemingly without a script, while everyone in the pupuseria listened intently; even the workers turned to watch or glanced at it as they multi tasked. ‘For once, justice is served,’ the atmosphere whispered atop the sizzling of the grill.\\n\\nSoon, with a full belly and some alcohol in our blood, the moment of truth approached. Would they truly accept Bitcoin? Sure enough, Juan flashed a big grin when I asked, whipped out his Chivo wallet, and produced a QR code for me to scan. To my surprise, it was an on-chain nested Segwit address that began with a 3. Not discouraged, I asked for a lightning invoice, which confused Juan. It turns out, nobody had explained to him the difference, and he did not know if Chivo even had Lightning. A few taps later, however, it all worked out and I zapped him $6.05 from my Phoenix wallet.\\n\\n**2. Like asking for a doggie bag at a Michelin restaurant**\\n\\nEven though bitcoiners love to refer to Satoshi’s beloved invention as ‘the people’s money,’ the reality is that in most of the industrialized nations, Bitcoin has gained more footing as an investment vehicle than as something that captures the hopes and dreams of the poor and the financially marginalized. And though we are working hard to change that, and change it shall in due time, at the moment Bitcoin is mostly associated with the financial markets, tech investment proposals, venture funds and the sort.\\n\\nFor example, while Jack Mallers is constantly asked to speak on Bloomberg news, indicating the business community is developing a nuanced and sophisticated understanding of the issue, popular lefty outlets like DemocracyNow continue to stick to skewed and misinformed establishment narratives about Bitcoin. Nor is the media coverage the only sign of Bitcoin’s lack of purchase among the most disadvantaged. Each year, to join the biggest celebration and gathering of bitcoiners, the cheapest tickets will set you back hundreds of dollars, not including the cost of lodging and transportation. This is not a value judgment, just the reality on the ground.\\n\\nIn El Salvador, the equation seemed to be reversed.\\n\\nOur experience in the pupuseria replicated itself dozens of times during our stay in the country. From taxi drivers to stand vendors, we were able to successfully pay with Lightning quite consistently, about half of the time. But most curiously, adoption had the least penetration the more affluent the environment became.\\n\\nTake the example of our accommodations: we stayed at Hotel Armonia in San Salvador, and Captain Morgan Hostel by Lake Coatepeque. Both charged around $60 per night, and both accepted Lightning. In fact, I had some great banter about Bitcoin adoption with the staff at Hotel Armonia, and left a chalk note for posterity with the price of Bitcoin at Captain Morgan.\\n\\n[Captain Morgan Chalk Board](https://preview.redd.it/tmy0ga8euo6b1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&v=enabled&s=58b2bc715c7ca417b52ffe08e8c24c0a433a49ee)\\n\\nHowever, Hotel Equinoccio, by far the most expensive place in our list at $150 per night, did not take Bitcoin payments. From a pool by the volcano lake, to private jet skies, to a perfectly manicured lawn to sunbathe in and a menu with exotic ‘detox’ drinks, this place had it all. Except Bitcoin payments. In fact, when I asked Fernando, he gave me a strained, hard to decipher look. It was not confusion, for he most decidedly knew what Bitcoin ...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nAs regular readers of this newsletter know, I’m no Elon Musk fan . But when the man is right, he’s right. That’s the case when it comes to the Tesla CEO’s observation this week that “if Apple competes against the whole world, Apple will have the whole world against it. This is not a winning scenario.” Musk’s comment came in response to a tweet by Twitter cofounder Jack Dorsey who objected to a decision by Apple’s CEO to remove the fledgling social network Damus from the company’s app store on the grounds it let users send Bitcoin-based “tips” to each other. Dorsey replied to Musk: “indeed.” The episode is notable because it appears to be the first tweet in months for Dorsey, who has been silent on the platform after suggesting that Musk—who bought Twitter last year—was mismanaging the social network. But it’s also significant because the two men are influential billionaires who join numerous other entrepreneurs frustrated with Apple’s high-handed control over the app environment. Apple’s decision to evict Damus from its app store over tipping is tied to the company’s policy that app makers must hand over 30% of whatever money they receive as payment for digital content. That policy is why Amazon Prime doesn’t let users buy videos directly in the app but asks them instead to go to its website. In the case of Damus, as Dorsey wrote on Twitter, Apple’s justification for booting the app seems flimsy. Sending a Bitcoin tip to another user—Damus uses the low-cost Lightning network—is not really the same as purchasing content. But Apple is demanding its tax all the same. It’s hard not to view the iPhone move as just the latest example of its recent anti-crypto stance . That stance is convenient for Apple at a time when the company is muscling into payments, challenging the likes of PayPal, and working with Goldman Sachs to get a piece of the credit card business. Given that Bitcoin’s Lightning network offers a cheap and efficient alternative to move money around, it wouldn’t be surprising if Apple has decided to try and smother any such services in the crib. Story continues This is the price we pay for using Apple. Like many of you, I rely on the company’s tightly controlled ecosystem—iMessage, iCloud, and so on—and appreciate its convenience and security. These are the so-called golden handcuffs we agree to put on in embracing Apple. But as Musk implied, it feels like the handcuffs are getting tighter every year, and the company risks trading its history of innovation to become just another monopolist.

The funds experienced a total of 500,000 trades, racking up trading volumes of around $3.6 billion. However, Balchunas noted that these numbers may be adjusted due to transactions awaiting accounting settlement. Grayscale's ETF, the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), experienced an outflow of $579 million during the period. After deducting the GBTC outflows, the net total inflows across all spot Bitcoin ETFs stood at $819 million. The outflows from GBTC could be attributed to holders converting their shares following the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission's (SEC) approval of the ETF through a ruling change. Some GBTC holders are reportedly switching to lower-fee options from other fund managers. Grayscale is charging 1.50% while other asset managers like BlackRock are charging 0.25%. GBTC is one of the largest holders of Bitcoin, managing over $27 billion worth of the cryptocurrency. Shares of GBTC have been traded since 2013 but were not redeemable for Bitcoin until January 11.

', 'More than a decade after the first application was filed, the crypto industry finally has spot Bitcoin (BTC) exchange-traded funds in the United States. On Jan. 10, the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) approved Bitcoin ETF applications from ARK 21Shares, Invesco Galaxy, VanEck, WisdomTree, Fidelity, Valkyrie, BlackRock, Grayscale, Bitwise, Hashdex and Franklin Templeton. The SEC’s decision was a historic milestone for crypto, but the road was not smooth. It all started in 2013, when Gemini co-founders Cameron and Tyler Winklevoss filed the first application for a spot Bitcoin ETF in the United States.The decision by the SEC to approve a spot cryptocurrency ETF in the U.S. for the first time raised questions about the intentions of Gary Gensler, the commission’s chair. Since taking office, Gensler has often spoken about the risks of crypto investments, connecting digital assets to fraud and scams. However, Gensler was one of three commissioners who voted to approve the offerings. The 3-2 vote tally suggests the SEC chair may have been the deciding vote. Some community members suggested the SEC chair “voted with Wall Street,” as the expansion of crypto products is likely to bring in investor funds. Others speculated that “the writing was already on the wall” for the SEC to approve a spot Bitcoin ETF, given that the commission had been mandated by a federal court to review Grayscale’s offering.Not everyone is happy with the SEC’s decision. In her statement, SEC Commissioner Caroline Crenshaw — one of two commissioners to vote against the approval — wrote that the agency’s move to greenlight the Bitcoin-based investment vehicles was “unsound and ahistorical.” Better Markets, a nonprofit economic organization, also didn’t mince words in its criticism of the ETF decision, describing the asset as inherently worthless and without purpose. Gold advocate and Bitcoin critic Peter Schiff added his voice to the mix, saying that the approvals were nothing more than a series of new ways for speculators to gamble on Bitcoin.Honduras special zone recognizes Bitcoin as a unit of accountLess than two years after adopting Bitcoin as legal tender, Próspera, a special economic zone in Roatan, Honduras, has officially recognized Bitcoin as a unit of account — meaning it can now be used to measure the market value of goods and services. For the time being, tax liabilities of Bitcoin-electing entities will be determined in reference to BTC for internal accounting purposes but reported to Próspera Zone for Employment and Economic Development (ZEDE) in United States dollars or the Honduras lempira. Once the issues are resolved, entities will report tax liabilities (and pay the corresponding amounts) to Próspera ZEDE in BTC.\\xa0Continue readingGoogle Play Store blocks Binance, OKX in India\\xa0Google’s Play Store in India has removed Binance and OKX crypto exchange apps after the government issued a noncompliance notice against them. The removal follows a similar decision by Apple’s App Store in India in December 2023. Back then, the Indian Ministry of Finance’s Financial Intelligence Unit (FIU) issued a notice to Binance, Huobi, Kraken, Gate.io, KuCoin, Bitstamp, MEXC Global, Bittrex and Bitfinex for operating illegally in India. The FIU notice stated that any exchange providing services to Indian users must register as a “reporting entity” and submit statements to the income tax department. The FIU proposed that the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology block the websites of the mentioned exchanges due to non-compliance.Continue readingDo Kwon requested SEC trial postponement\\xa0Terraform Labs co-founder Do Kwon has requested the United States District Court for the Southern District of New York to postpone his trial date until March, citing extradition challenges in Montenegro as the reason for seeking the delay. In a letter addressed to Judge Jed Rakoff, Kwon’s legal team emphasized his interest in attending the trial personally, which is scheduled for Jan. 29. However, they had anticipated that Kwon would have already been permitted to return to the U.S. by now.\\xa0In February 2023, the SEC filed fraud charges against Kwon, accusing him of having a role in orchestrating a multibillion-dollar crypto securities fraud. The charges were related to the collapse of Terraform Labs’ stablecoin TerraUSD (USTC) and its associated Terra (LUNA) token. While recognizing the urgency of the trial, Kwon’s legal team indicated that this month’s trial date would not be feasible for him to attend.Continue reading\\n'], [122906, 'price-analysis-1-15-spx-dxy-btc-eth-bnb-sol-xrp-ada-avax-doge', 6768, 'Price analysis 1/15: SPX, DXY, BTC, ETH, BNB, SOL, XRP, ADA, AVAX, DOGE', '2024-01-15 18:05:00', 'Bitcoin price is trying to stabilize after a sharp fall, indicating that the froth may be out of the system.

Source: TradingViewThe upsloping moving averages indicate that buyers have the upper hand, but the negative divergence on the relative strength index (RSI) warrants caution. If the value maintains above 4,800, the index is likely to ascend to the psychologically important level of 5,000.On the downside, the 20-day EMA is the first support to keep an eye on. If this level gives way, it will suggest that the buying pressure is reducing. The index may then fall to the 50-day simple moving average (4,601).U.S. Dollar Index price analysisThe U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) has been consolidating in a downtrend near the 20-day EMA (102) for the past several days.DXY daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe flat 20-day EMA and the RSI near the midpoint do not give a clear advantage either to the bulls or the bears. If the price sustains below the 20-day EMA, the bears will try to pull the index to the critical support at 101.On the upside, the bulls are likely to face selling at the 50-day SMA (103). A break and close above the 50-day SMA will suggest the start of a stronger recovery to 104.50. This level may again witness strong selling by the bears.Bitcoin price analysisBitcoin broke and closed below the support line on Jan. 14, signaling that the bears are trying to make a comeback.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe 20-day EMA ($43,693) has started to turn down, and the RSI is near 46, suggesting that the bears hold a slight edge. Any recovery attempt is likely to face selling at the 20-day EMA. If the price turns down from the overhead resistance, it will signal a shift in the sentiment from buying on dips to selling on rallies. The BTC/USDT pair may fall to $40,000 and later to $37,980.Contrary to this assumption, if buyers overcome the barrier at $44,700, it will suggest that the corrective phase may be over. The pair will then try to reach the psychologically important level of $50,000.Ether price analysisEther (ETH) is correcting in an uptrend with the bulls trying to keep the price above the immediate support at $2,458.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($2,398) and the RSI in the positive zone indicate that the bulls are in command. If the price turns up from the current level or rebounds off $2,400, it will signal strong buying on dips. The ETH/USDT pair may then rally to $2,717. If this level is scaled, the next stop could be $3,000.This positive view will be negated in the near term if the price continues lower and plunges below $2,400. That could sink the pair to the 50-day SMA ($2,282) and eventually to $2,100.BNB price analysisBNB (BNB) dipped below the 20-day EMA ($301) on Jan. 12, but the bears could not sustain the price below the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of $291.BNB/USDT daily chart.

The $350 level is likely to attract strong selling by the bears, but if bulls overcome this barrier, the pair may soar to $400.The important level to watch on the downside is $291 because a slump below it could tug the price to the neckline.XRP price analysisAttempts by the bulls to start a recovery in XRP (XRP) stalled near the downtrend line on Jan. 11, suggesting that the bears remain in control.XRP/USDT daily chart.

The securities regulator approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs last week. &#8220;There’s an irony in the midst of that.

This was about centralization and traditional means of finance. He added: &#8220;Investors could already express themselves in bitcoin. You could already, before this week, buy it through major brokerage houses, but now you can buy it through this thing called an exchange-traded product as well, centralized,” he noted. &#8220;There’s a lot of centralization here.&#8221; The securities regulator approved 11 spot bitcoin ETFs last week.

IMF Chief on Crypto and US Dollar Dominance The managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), Kristalina Georgieva, dismissed crypto as money and explained why she didn&#x2019;t see bitcoin as a threat to the U.S. dollar&#x2019;s dominance in an interview with Yahoo Finance Live last week. Georgieva said: Our view is that we have to differentiate between money and assets. When we talk about crypto, we are actually talking about an asset class. &#x201C;It could be backed up and in that sense, more secure and less risky, or it could be not backed up and therefore a riskier investment.

Because of the size of U.S. economy and most importantly, the depth of the capital markets in the U.S. &#x201C;So I, for one, am not in a rush to turn my dollars into another currency.

Let's look at how divisibility is different for different things and how it importantly depends on what the utility of the item is. \\n\\nYou referred to the pizza argument. Let's also add a new element, a car. And also to help clarify the argument let's assume everything is taking place on a small island of 100 people. It is trivial to understand how easily this argument can be expanded to a planet (simply a larger island) with billions of people.\\n\\nOk, so on our island we only have 1 car, 1 pizza and 1 Bitcoin.\\n\\nThe car has a utility: to move people around the island.\\n\\nThe pizza has a utility: to feed people on the island.\\n\\nThe bitcoin has a utility: to allow commerce on the island. \\n\\nIf we take that car and try to divide it into pieces the utility is immediately destroyed.  Because of this, the value becomes worthless.  What would you pay for 1/2 of the car? On this island I'd pay nothing as it cannot perform any useful task.  The car was a scarce commodity and had value. It cannot be divided at all without destroying both it's value and it's scarcity.  In this case one and only one person can own the car.   This makes the car very valuable to the island residents. Specifically because it is scarce and useful. \\n\\nLet's now split up the pizza. In this case we can split it up within reason and the parts are still useful.  However, again there is a limit. What value would you place on 1/8th of the pizza? Probably about an 1/8th or so of the value of the entire pizza.  What about 1 millionth of the pizza? Probably worth nothing to you as you would most likely need a microscope to even see it.  So, those pieces of pizza are in fact scarce and that, plus the great flavor and nutrition, give it a large value. \\n\\nNow let's look at the Bitcoin. Well, we only have one but many people need to do transactions. Ok, let's split up the Bitcoin into 100 parts. This is trivially easy because Bitcoin is a digital currency.  Now each person has a piece. The important part is that each of these pieces has the same functionality as the original. Each part is exactly as useful as a medium of exchange. Exactly as useful as the original in fact. \\n\\nNow each person wants to do more transactions and needs a smaller unit so they can do more than one single transaction. Ok. We can continue dividing the Bitcoin into smaller and smaller parts and they still have a utility and still function as a currency. Divide it into a billion parts? No problem. Each part still has the same utility it's simply worth a billionth of the total. \\n\\nHeck, we can also simply invent Bitcoin2.0 and it also functions exactly the same as a currency and we can again divide it up as much as we would like and each part still operates as a unit of exchange. \\n\\nThe important point here is that there is no scarcity to the Bitcoin. Everyone can have some. The value of it bares no relationship to the number we started with.  We could have started with 2 or 20 or 2 trillion and everything stays the same. The value simply does not depend on the quantity at all as it is infinitely divisible and you can make infinite copies.\\n\\nFinally, think about a shared Google spreadsheet, not far off from what Bitcoin is (a shitty and slow spreadsheet to be fair).  If you are doing calculations in one cell does it matter at all if someone else adds many new rows? Does it affect the usefulness of your part? What about if they add a whole sheet? \\n\\nThere is a big difference between actually scarce goods and those that are not. Cells in a crappy append only spreadsheet are not.\", '196u1w5'], ['u/NakamotoScheme', 20, '2024-01-15 01:26', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Buttcoin/comments/196u1w5/bitcoin_divisibility_critique/khw7z56/', 'I see your point.

The world's biggest cryptocurrency rose to $42,162, its highest since April 2022, seemingly casting off the gloom that had settled over crypto markets following the collapse of FTX and other crypto-business failures last year. It was up 8.27% at $42,005 as of 20:00 GMT. Bitcoin's gains lifted the shares of cryptocurrency-related companies, as well as exchange-traded funds (ETFs) listed in the United States. Coinbase jumped 7% and Microstrategy gained 6.3%, while bitcoin miners such as Riot Platforms , Marathon Digital and CleanSpark rose between 7% and 13%. Last week, Microstrategy disclosed it bought an additional $593 million in bitcoin during November. The ProShares Bitcoin Strategy ETF, which tracks bitcoin futures, rose 7.5%, while the ProShares Short Bitcoin Strategy ETF that allows traders to bet on a fall in bitcoin futures dropped 7.5%. Bitcoin's \"remarkable ascent\" can be attributed to a \"confluence of factors\" that were buoying sentiment, Luuk Strijers, chief commercial officer of crypto derivatives exchange Deribit, wrote in a note on Monday. He cited widespread optimism that the U.S. securities regulator may soon approve a spot bitcoin ETF, which would throw open the bitcoin market to millions more investors. Abating inflation would lead central banks to begin easing rate hikes, making riskier assets more attractive, he said, and noted a steady increase in institutional engagement. Bitcoin is up by more than 150% so far this year. Riskier investments and other interest-rate sensitive assets, such as gold, have also rallied hard over the last few weeks as markets wager that the U.S. Federal Reserve has finished hiking rates and will start cutting early in 2024. Reports in October that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) would not appeal a court ruling that the agency had been wrong to reject its spot bitcoin ETF application have also driven bets that an eventual approval is near. SEC Chair Gary Gensler said in October the agency's commissioners would potentially consider as many as 10 bitcoin ETF filings, but could not provide guidance on timing. Story continues A spot bitcoin ETF could allow previously wary investors access to crypto via the tightly regulated stock market. Demand is expected to be as much as $3 billion in the first few days of trading, and pull in billions more thereafter. Investors are confident the SEC could approve multiple spot bitcoin ETFs as early as January, based on key public SEC filing and comment deadlines, Matteo Greco, research analyst at digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, wrote in a note. \"An approval is expected to bring short-term capital influx from the traditional finance investors.\" Investors have also welcomed the settlement of a years-long U.S. criminal probe into Binance, the world's largest crypto exchange and a key cog in the worldwide crypto market. The deal, in which Binance founder Changpeng Zhao stepped down after pleading guilty to breaking U.S. anti-money laundering laws, allows the company to continue operating. Ether, the coin linked to the Ethereum blockchain network, rose more than 6% on Monday, hitting $2,274.88. Both bitcoin and ether remain far below their 2021 record highs of $69,000 and $4,868, respectively.

Gradually, the service will be expanded globally.\nWith all the buzz around cryptocurrency and a marked rise in its value might lure investors to put money on cryptocurrency.

Moreover, Mastercard enables companies to accept cryptocurrency payments on its network. Besides,Global Payments Inc.GPN partnered with BitPay to allow merchants to accept Bitcoins. However, the legendary Warren Buffett calls cryptocurrencies \"risky\" and \"worthless.\nPrice of Bitcoin, the most popular of crypto, increased this year after finding support in Elon Musk and Jack Dorsey. But the last trading day robbed some of its sheen after Elon Musk stated that his company Tesla will stop accepting it for car purchases, citing environmental damages that Bitcoin mining causes.\nMoneyGram’s decision to utilize its infrastructure for crypto transactions will help it monetize its already developed asset. This will also provide additional avenues of revenue diversification. There are numerous companies that accept crypto as a valid form of payment.\nMoneyGram tried its hands at crypto by partnering with Ripple in 2019. The deal allowed the company to use Ripple's product XRP for cross-border payment and foreign exchange settlement. The partnership came to an end after regulators charged Ripple for conducting a $1.3-billion illegal securities offering.

Partially reversing a 2.73% gain from Saturday, Bitcoin ended the week down by 10.36% to $58,691.0. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to a late morning intraday low $58,603.0 before making a move. Steering clear of the first major support level at $58,182, Bitcoin rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $60,050.0. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $60,618, however, Bitcoin fell back to end the day at sub-$59,000 levels. The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest pullback to sub-$56,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $28,814 to form a near-term bearish trend. The Rest of the Pack Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Sunday. Crypto.com Coin jumped by 26.39% to lead the way. Bitcoin Cash SV (+0.12%), Chainlink (+2.48%), and Polkadot (+1.46%) also bucked the trend on the day. It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however. Cardano’s ADA fell by 4.55% to lead the way down. Binance Coin (-3.37%), Ethereum (-3.47%), Litecoin (-2.44%), and Ripple’s XRP (-3.41%) also joined Bitcoin in the red. It was also a mixed week ending 21 st November for the majors. Crypto.com Coin surged by 65.35%, with Polkadot (+1.02%) also finding support to buck the broader market trend. Litecoin tumbled by 20.72% to lead the way down, however, with Chainlink (-13.85%) also deep in the red. Binance Coin (-10.16%), Bitcoin Cash SV (-10.46%), Cardano’s ADA (-9.95%), and Ripple’s XRP (-10.67%) also saw heavy losses. Ethereum fell by a more modest 7.86% in the week, however. In the week, the crypto total market rose to a Monday high $2,904bn before falling to a Friday low $2,393bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $2,567bn. Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Thursday high 44.28% before falling to a Friday low 42.34%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 42.92%. This Morning At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.61% to $58,334.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $58,829.0 before falling to a low $58,083.0. Story continues Bitcoin tested the first major support level at $58,179 early on. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day. Crypto.com Coin was up by 6.63%, with Bitcoin Cash SV (+1.11%) and Polkadot (+0.29% also finding support. It was a bearish start for the rest, however. At the time of writing, Chainlink was down by 1.99% to lead the way down. For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move through the $59,115 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $59,626 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $59,000 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Sunday’s high $60,050.0 would likely cap the upside. In the event of an extended rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $63,000 levels before easing back. The second major resistance level sits at $60,562. Failure to move through the $59,115 pivot would bring the first major support level at $58,179 back into play. Barring an extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$57,000 levels. The second major support level at $57,668 should limit the downside.

Writing in theGuardianon Monday, Rogoff stated that while some believe that cryptocurrencies have had their day and are on an irreversible downward slide, it is actually difficult to say with certainty that their value will actually fall to zero.\nIn his view, several questions exist about the ability of large economies to successfully embrace cryptocurrency, which means that outside of joint regulatory action, national level adoption of cryptocurrencies will likely be pushed only by weak pariah states likeIran, Somalia,Venezuela, andNorth Korea. This he says, makes it difficult to predict the eventual fate of this asset class.\nIn the article, Rogoff calls into question the very intrinsic value of bitcoin, stating that its generally held status as “digital gold” is unsustainable because unlike realgold, it has no application outside of a monetary setting, and the massive energy consumption required to keep it functioning is substantially less efficient than a central banking system.\nAccording to him, large economies will not tolerate cryptocurrencies in their current state much longer because of their capacity to facilitatemoney laundering, and yet if their anonymity/pseudnymity is stripped away, they will lose their mass appeal, which effectively placesbitcoinin a catch-22 position. As a result, Rogoff believes that the long-term use and adoption of cryptocurrency in its current form lies outside of large, regulated economies, which essentially will make it the preserve of a group of failed states like Venezuela, which has made several headlines with its plan to revitalise its devastated economy with thepetro.\nRaising further question about the future of bitcoin, Rogoff said:\n“Regulators are gradually waking up to the fact that they cannot countenance large expensive-to-trace transaction technologies that facilitate tax evasion and criminal activity. At the same time, central banks from Sweden to China are realising that they, too, can issue digital currencies…When it comes to new forms of money, the private sector may innovate, but in due time the government regulates and appropriates.”\nIn Rogoff’s opinion, what this will lead to is essentially a lottery scenario where bitcoin’slong-term valueis likely to be closer to $100, but may possibly also be $100,000 for a plethora of reasons that are difficult to even visualise at the moment. Explaining why even a widespread public belief in bitcoin as a store of value is not enough to hold its value over time, he stated:\n“Economists (including me) who have worked on this kind of problem for five decades have found that price bubbles surrounding intrinsically worthless assets must eventually burst.

International Bullion Buyers Are Interested in Alternative Payment Methods Ken Lewis, chief executive officer at Onegold, explained that credit card chargebacks were one of the big reasons the company chose to accept BCH and BTC. Because the digital assets act like cash and are a &#x201C;push transaction&#x201D; system, users need to pay for products up front, making traditional fraud cases much harder to accomplish. Lewis also detailed that blockchain payments provide greater accountability and some international buyers are more apt to purchase Onegold&#x2019;s collateralized assets using cryptocurrencies. &#x201C;We anticipate a large number of cryptocurrency buyers from international markets, where accepting credit cards is not always practical,&#x201D; Lewis explained during the announcement. &#x201C;In addition to helping protect our own interests, adding bitcoin and bitcoin cash to the payment options for Onegold also increases our payment transparency and efficiency.&#x201D; Onegold Believes Cryptographically Secured Metals Are Better Than Exchange-Traded Funds Onegold believes that its digital bullion is far superior to gold-backed paper like exchange-traded funds (ETF), such as the gold trust Comex and LBMA Gold. Both products are similar because they can be electronically traded, but Onegold is cryptographically secured by a distributed ledger and has 100 percent physical metal backing. The Onegold system. Onegold customers can redeem their stored assets with the click of a button, and have physical metals shipped to their door by Apmex. Quite a few gold and silver ETFs cannot be redeemed so quickly and some cannot be traded for physical assets at all, making customers settle for fiat. Onegold believes adding the ability to purchase digital metals with cryptocurrencies was the company&#x2019;s next logical step.

Pseudonymous cab driver Dave Jenkins is known as the Crypto Cabbie because as he drives passengers around London he provides the ability to purchase BTC. Also read:&#xA0;Only Five Bitcoin Mining Devices Released in 2018 Are Profitable This December Meet the Crypto Cabbie There&#x2019;s a taxi driver in London who will not only give you a ride, but might also ask you if you&#x2019;re interested in purchasing BTC. Dave Jenkins travels with a device that enables people to purchase bitcoins. As he explained in a&#xA0;recent interview, the hardware is manufactured by a company called Fastbitcoins, and allows the Crypto Cabbie to sell BTC for cash before furnishing the buyer with a receipt. Essentially, the service is a voucher system that can be redeemed for BTC after the purchase at certain locations. Jenkins says dealing with him is much easier for customers than signing up for an exchange or using a crypto ATM in London that might require KYC identification. The Crypto Cabbie reckons he&#x2019;s the first taxi driver to offer cryptocurrency purchases. &#x201C;You know, you just turn up, get in the cab, hand the cash over and you&#x2019;ve got your bitcoin and away you go,&#x201D; Jenkins explained during his interview. The Crypto Cabbie is good friends with Danny Brewster, the creator of the U.K.-based Fastbitcoins point-of-sale (PoS) terminal company. Hailing a Cab in the Digital World According to Brewster, he sells the crypto-enabled PoS devices to retail stores and businesses worldwide and is confident of developing his business during the crypto bear market, believing it makes his company stronger. His buddy Jenkins has been accepting BTC for taxi rides since 2017 and doesn&#x2019;t seem concerned by its drop in value.&#xA0;The Crypto Cabbie explained: I only care about owning bitcoin itself &#x2014; Bitcoin to bitcoin, satoshi to satoshi, whatever. Jenkins noted that to hail his cab in the digital world, individuals can contact his Twitter handle and provide him with a pickup location. While being driven to their destination, passengers can purchase BTC from the taxi driver using pounds, euros, and U.S. dollars. However, Jenkins only sells BTC during his regular shift hours which are 9 a.m. to 5 p.m. in London. The cabbie professes to only makes a few cents&#x2019; worth of BTC for his efforts but doesn&#x2019;t sell the coins to make money. Rather, he simply enjoys getting more people into cryptocurrencies. &#x201C;I don&#x2019;t feel I&#x2019;m going to become a millionaire out of it,&#x201D; the cab driver conceded.

With super bearish prices these past few months, a lot has changed since the cryptocurrency economy touched all-time highs on spot markets. Meanwhile, bitcoin futures contracts have been growing and some skeptics still believe these derivatives products are disruptive toward cryptocurrency spot prices. Also Read: Law Professor: Confusing Crypto Regulations Will Hamper Innovation Have Futures Products &#x2018;Tamed&#x2019; Bitcoin&#x2019;s Spot Price? A few weeks before the launch of Cboe and CME Group&#x2019;s bitcoin-based futures contracts, the price of bitcoin core (BTC) spiked significantly. After Cboe&#x2019;s launch seven days later, the cryptocurrency touched an all-time high of $19,600 per coin and the value has been depleting ever since. On the opposite side of the spectrum, as the price of BTC went down on many occasions, bitcoin derivatives volumes on both CME and Cboe skyrocketed. A recent CME liquidity report for Dec. 7 shows bitcoin futures volumes rallied in November, just before the price was about to experience some heavy losses. The same can be said for the month of October as CME&#x2019;s BTC futures contracts saw significant average daily volume (ADV) growth. Cboe&#x2019;s ADV statistics show the exact same pattern throughout all the false bull traps and subsequent dumps all year long. Cboe and CME Group are the largest FX exchanges in the world and have been selling BTC-based derivatives products since December of last year. Skeptics think and have believed that futures markets have caused the long-term crypto-downturn and think futures actually &#x2018;set the price of BTC.&#x2019; Many believe that when precious metals (PM) derivatives products were first introduced they defined and suppressed the price of PMs like gold and silver. Bitcoiners will also remember that CME chairman emeritus Leo Melamed told Reuters last year that futures markets would &#x201C;tame&#x201D; BTC. &#xA0; &#x201C;We will regulate, make bitcoin not wild, nor wilder. We&#x2019;ll tame it into a regular type instrument of trade with rules,&#x201D; said the senior figure at CME Group. CME&#x2019;S bitcoin futures report July 12, 2018.

Well, today I present a succinct overview of key characteristics of the VeChain model that show value creation is inherent to its two token system.\\n\\nThe VeChain model comprises two tokens, VET and VTHO.\\n\\nVET is the smart currency, able to freely appreciate at the market’s whim. VET is used to settle smart contracts or as a monetary medium that can be used to invest in ICOs.\\n\\nVTHO is the unit consumed when writing data to the Blockchain. VTHO is produced by holding VET, directly in to the wallet holding VET, each block (every 10 seconds).\\n\\nAppreciation comes via a variety of mechanisms:\\n\\nVTHO must be purchased from holders, by businesses, to fulfill their Blockchain needs. This automatically gives VET intrinsic value as it provides vital functionality. Something no other token can boast.\\n\\nAs time goes by, activity on the mainnet will increase as partners deploy their solutions. For example, the recent news about China using VeChain for a [natural gas facility](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/vechain-partners-with-leading-chinese-energy-companies-to-pilot-blockchain-enabled-liquified-natural-gas-solution-300741922.html)\\u200a—\\u200aon the day of testing (19th Oct) the testnet clocked over a million transactions and this wasn’t even running all day. On the 7th of November the testnet clocked over 2 million transactions, again, only running for a portion of the day. VeChain’s data capacity is huge.\\n\\nConsider the recent carbon bank use cases\\u200a—\\u200aevery step of supply chain will be tracked to provide carbon data and quality assurance to the end user (product is called [Bright Code](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4xQD37JPZtc)). Bright Foods, one of the companies involved also plans to use VeChain throughout its entire supply chain, from seed to product. Every single step of the way requiring VTHO. Writing temperature/salinity/soil PH data in the green house? VTHO. Logistics data? VTHO. Carbon emissions relating to the transport used? VTHO\\n\\nThey are working with BYD (an electric car manufacturer) and rewarding EV drivers with [carbon credits](https://cryptovest.com/news/vechain-byd-build-blockchain-carbon-monitoring-app/). Guess how the drivers upload their data? VTHO (and VeChain’s patented [Multi Party Payment protocol](https://medium.com/@vechainofficial/introducing-the-vechain-multi-party-payment-protocol-525daf1bee7), enabling the user to never have to own crypto yet still use the blockchain\\u200a—\\u200amass adoption 101).\\n\\n[DNVGL’s MyStory](https://www.dnvgl.com/mystory/mystory-project.html)? The supply chain uses VTHO throughout.\\n\\nAll these other massive, multi billion dollar partners using VeChain in their supply chains? VTHO VTHO VTHO.\\n\\nThe demand for VTHO which comes by proxy of VeChain’s (already massive) adoption in turn makes VET valuable as a product of its relationship as the chicken that produces the VTHO egg.\\n\\nWhen VTHO consumption begins to outstrip supply, the foundation can increase the base generation rate of VTHO, in turn, making VET more valuable. Demand for VTHO, a byproduct of using the VeChain Blockchain, in turn increases the value of both VET and VTHO.\\n\\nOver 65% of VET supply is locked up in nodes and node reward pools currently. Since the the 1st of September when this initial observation was made, a billion more VET have gone in to wallets and nodes. When circulating supply dries up, supply and demand kick in. Price goes up. In a few years, when things are really up and running, businesses will be buying from the open market. They won’t care about paying $1 or $2 per VET. They’ll buy a ton at once to provide the VTHO they require for their activities. For those of us here now buying it for fractions of a penny, well, that will certainly be a great day.\\n\\nAnother appreciation factor are the ICOs. VeChain sponsored ICOs have to raise at least 50% of funds in VET and hold them for a minimum of 2 years. This has the effect of massively reducing circulating supply again. Some recent ICOs have opted for as high as 80% FYI.\\n\\nThere will also be those seeking passive income adding to the demand, sucking up liquid supply. VTHO is free for VET holders after all, and businesses will always need it. VET holders are also likely to buy more VET with their VTHO, creating constant positive pressure on VET’s price and in turn, growing the rate at which holders can produce VTHO, creating a positive feedback loop. Then there’s good old speculation from those hedging their bets on VeChain’s success, which, given its illustrious list of partners, seems inevitable. It is working with 6 state backed companies in China for one, this is a green light from China, a market of 1.3 billion. Then there’s the multitude of other, massive multinationals on board\\u200a—\\u200aBYD, BMW (via their startup program, yes), DB Schenker, collaborative work with DHL and Kuehne and Nagel, Renault, I mean, the list goes on.\\n\\nVeChain’s value comes via the staggeringly high volume of transactions that will run through its Blockchain and subsequent demand...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nThe views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph. Every investment and trading move involves risk, you should conduct your own research when making a decision.\nMarket data is provided by theHitBTCexchange.\nDoes a crash in prices indicate the decaying fundamentals of an asset class? In many instances it does, but the market usually gets the fundamentals of an emerging technology wrong, both in the short term and in the long term.\nIn May 1997, Amazon’s share price was quoting at $18. Short-term expectations propelled it to $300 by December 1998 and from there it slumped to $6 per share after the dotcom bubble burst. At that point, the market was severely underestimating its potential and the non-believers were claiming victory. However, the model proved everyone wrong, and Amazon became the second company in the history to reach a market capitalization of$1 trillion.\nBlockchain entrepreneur and industry advisor, Vinny Lingham, said toCointelegraph: “The climate can change once more companies with solid use cases emerge from their development cycles, gain traction and prove sound business value to make a difference.” Just because the prices have crashed, it doesn’t signal the end of an asset class.\nAs the price action in the near-term is dictated by technicals, let’s look at the charts and forecast the probable price action.\nDuring a waterfall decline, support levels are not honored, making it difficult to predict the bottom. The pullbacks also usually last only for about 1–3 days.Bitcoinattempted a recovery on Nov.r 21 that failed at $4,799.74.\nSubsequently, theBTC/USDpair has resumed its downtrend, making a new low. Both the moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is deep in the oversold territory. This shows that the sellers are in command.\nThe immediate support on the downside is $4,100, below which, the fall can extend to $3,500– $3,000.\nAny recovery attempt will face stiff resistance at the downtrend line and $5,000. Though we want to use the current fall to buy, we believe that the traders should wait for a level to hold before initiating any long positions.\nRipplehas broken down of the uptrend line, which shows that it is also being affected by negative sentiment. However, it remains well above its lows, which confirms its outperformance.\nThe moving averages have started to turn down and the RSI has dipped below 40, which suggests that the supply is outpacing demand.\nThe next support on the downside is $0.37185 and below that, $0.26913. TheXRP/USDpair will point to a consolidation if the prices quickly scale above the uptrend line and the moving averages flatten out. For now, it is best to stay on the sidelines.\nEthereumis not finding buyers at higher levels. The pullback stalled at $141.91, which shows a lack of buying support.\nCurrently, the bears are attempting to extend the decline to the next support level at $110. Though anything is possible in the markets, we believe that the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback. We don not recommend trading on hope, hence, we shall wait for a new buy setup to form before suggesting any trade in it.\nOn the upside, theETH/USDpair will face a stiff hurdle at $167.32. The 20-day EMA is also close to this level, making it a critical resistance to cross for the bulls.\nStellaris at a critical level. If the bears sustain prices below $0.184, it will be negative and can result in the start of a new down move. The lower levels to watch on the downside are $0.1547188 that is the intraday low of March 18 and $0.138565, which is the intraday low hit on Dec. 22 of last year.\nConversely, if the bulls successfully defend the $0.184 level, theXLM/USDpair, might pull back to the 20-day EMA and above it to the downtrend line. We suggest traders wait for a new buy setup to form before entering any long positions.\nThoughEOShas broken down of the critical support at $3.8723, it has not plunged. This shows some buying support at lower levels. The oversold reading on the RSI also points to a recovery attempt.\nIf the bulls scale $3.8723, a move to the downtrend line and above it to $4.493 is probable. The 20-day EMA is also located close to this level, hence, $4.493 will act as a major roadblock.\nIf theEOS/USDpair fails to rise above $3.8723, it can slump to $3. We do not find any bullish patterns developing, hence, we are not proposing a trade in it.\nThe bulls have been attempting to hold the support at $32 for the past three days, but have not been able to pushLitecoinhigher.\nStill, the oversold levels on the RSI point to a probable pullback. On the upside, theLTC/USDpair will face stiff resistance at the 20-day EMA and above that at the $47.246–$49.466 zone.\nOn the other hand, if the bears sink prices below the support zone of $32–$29.653, the fall can extend to the next support at $20.\nThe pullback inCardanocould not scale the $0.05 level and the price is back at the support of $0.041.\nIf theADA/USDpair breaks down and sustains below $0.041, it can slide to the next lower target of $0.025954.\nOn the other hand, if the bulls succeed in rebounding from close to current levels, the digital currency will again attempt to break out of $0.05. If successful, the pullback can extend to $0.060105, which is likely to act a major resistance because this is the previous support and the 20-day EMA is also close to this level.\nThough the bulls attempted a pullback inMoneroon Nov. 21 and 22, they could not push prices above $72. As a result, the price turned down once again.\nIn this down leg, if theXMR/USDpair plunges below $60, the fall can extend to the next support at $46.\nIf the virtual currency finds buyers at the current levels, the bulls will again attempt to break out of the $72 level. If this level is crossed, the pullback can continue to next overhead resistance of $81.\nTRONcould not scale above the previous support-turned-resistance of $0.01587681 in the past two days. However, a small positive is that the bulls have held prices above the Nov. 20 intraday low of $0.0122194.\nWe anticipate the bulls to make another attempt to climb above $0.01587681 and reach the next resistance of $0.0183.\nHowever, contrary to our expectation, if theTRX/USDpair plummets below $0.0122194, the fall can extend to the next lower level of $0.00844479.\nDashcontinues to trade near the support of the descending channel. This shows that sellers have the upper hand.\nAny breakdown of the channel will be a negative development that can push theDASH/USDpair down to the next support at $75.\nIf the support of the channel holds, the bulls will attempt another pullback to scale $120 levels and reach the next overhead resistance of $129.58. We believe that the traders should wait for a trend reversal before initiating any long positions.\nMarket data is provided by theHitBTCexchange.

A lack of movement through the early part of the morning left the major support and resistance levels untested.\nFor the day ahead, holding above $332.50 levels would support a run at the first major resistance level at $338.28.\nBitcoin Cash ABC would need the support of the broader market, however, to break out from Thursday’s high $337.7.\nBarring a broad-based crypto rally, Bitcoin Cash ABC would likely come up short of $340 levels on the day.\nFailure to hold above $332.50 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC hit reverse. A fall through to sub-$330 levels would bring the first major support level at $327.13 into play.\nBarring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin Cash ABC should steer clear of sub-$320 levels on the day.

Litecoin’s last closeout at sub-$90 was on 27thJuly…\nAt the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 1.19% to $88.93.

He did note that he views Bitcoin’s finite supply as a bonus to its investment value, saying:\\n“They’re both collectibles. The value is based off supply and demand. And the good news about Bitcoin is there’s a finite supply that’ll ever be created.”\\nHowever, Cuban did say that he sees gold and Bitcoin as “being the same thing,” and has a very low view of gold. Regarding his stance on the precious metal, Cuban emphasized that to convey his feelings on gold as an investment, he would have to say:\\n“Hate with extreme prejudice is not enough. Hate with double-extreme prejudice with an ounce of hot sauce.”\\nGold and digital gold\\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, the origin of the term “digital gold” to refer to Bitcoin is unknown, but one theory is that it came into vogue after The New York Times journalist Nathaniel Popper published his book “Digital Gold” back in 2015.\\nNow in 2019, a number of experts have given responses as to whether they consider Bitcoin to be digital gold. Sonya Mann, the head of communications at the Zcash Foundation, discussed her answer in terms of both its finite quantity and supply and demand factors. Mann, for her part, appears much more optimistic than Cuban. She remarked:\\n“Bitcoin is deflationary by nature, due to the capped 21 million supply and the clever incentive structure that has reliably safeguarded its inviolability. The emergent order governing Bitcoin, as both a software product and a phenomenon, is undeniably path-dependent, attributable in large part to Satoshi Nakamoto's design decisions. There is no guarantee that BTC will increase in value, but past trends and the underlying supply-demand dynamics suggest that it's a reasonable long-term prediction.”\\n\"], [29804, 'disgruntled-bitcoin-investor-brings-225m-class-action-suit-to-israeli-bank', 5083, 'Disgruntled Bitcoin Investor Brings $22.5M Class Action Suit to Israeli Bank', '2019-08-09 20:40:00', 'A Bitcoin investor is bringing a class action suit against an Israeli bank in light of their refusal to accept deposits of funds made from crypto trading.', \"\\nAn unnamed investor has filed a lawsuit against the Israeli Bank Hapoalim in the amount of approximately $22.5 million, on account of the bank allegedly refusing to accept deposits of profits earned via Bitcoin (BTC).\\xa0\\nIndustry media outlet BlockTV discussed the lawsuit in a report on Aug. 9. According to the report, the complaint is being filed as a class action suit, and the investor ultimately plans to sue other Israeli banks on the same grounds.\\xa0\\nAccording to the report, Israeli banks are largely anti-crypto because they wish to avoid being scrutinized in connection with crypto-related firms and individuals. However, the disgruntled investor’s lawyer, Lior Lahav, has said that this is not sufficient grounds for banks to refuse services to cryptocurrency investors. Lahav stated:\\n“The banks have an obligation under the law to accept money from the clients [...] They can check on their clients, do their due diligence, and find out where the money is coming from. The problem with the banks is that they are doing nothing. They are not asking their clients: ‘Provide me documentation of the origin of the money.'”\\nLahav further illustrated the scale of the issue, arguing that there are tens of thousands of Israeli investors who are similarly being punished for no apparent wrongdoing:\\n“There are more than 70,000 bitcoin investors in Israel who are facing the same problem from their banks [...] 99 percent of them are ordinary people that invested in a thing that’s completely legal.”\\nRoss Gross\\nLahav pointedly noted that his client is not Ross Gross. Gross is a Bitcoin investor who claimed that the bank Hapoalim refused to accept his deposit, purportedly because it came from crypto trading profits.\\nAs previously reported by Cointelegraph, Gross began investing in Bitcoin back in 2011, and has reported his earnings to the Israeli tax authority. However, as of 2017, Bank Hapoalim stopped accepting his deposits of funds earned from Bitcoin trading.\\xa0\\nAs a result, Gross has not been able to pay his capital gains taxes and the tax authority has put a lien on his bank account, home and scooters. Gross said, “the tax authority is aware of the problem, but they say the ball isn’t in their court.”\\n\"], [29803, 'price-analysis-09-08-btc-eth-xrp-bch-ltc-bnb-eos-bsv-xmr-xlm', 19231, 'Price Analysis 09/08: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, LTC, BNB, EOS, BSV, XMR, XLM', '2019-08-09 20:21:00', 'Bitcoin is at a critical level.

Therefore, Grayscale believes that the leading cryptocurrency is a good addition to long-term investment portfolios.BTC/USDThough Bitcoin (BTC) has sustained above the downtrend line for the past three days, it has failed to pick up momentum.

If this fails to hold, the ETH/USD pair might plummet to $164 and below it to $150. Conversely, if the support at $192.945 holds, the pair might remain range-bound for a few days.

Hence, we anticipate the price to bounce off it once again.The strength of the bounce will give us a clue as to whether the support will hold or crack. If the rebound off $0.27795 is weak, it will indicate a lack of buying interest among bulls and will increase the probability of a breakdown. The XRP/USD pair will start a new downtrend below $0.27795 that can drag it to $0.19.Conversely, if the price bounces off sharply from $0.27795, bulls will try to carry it above the 20-day EMA.

The court subsequently set a new date to hear the case relating to crypto regulation. Meanwhile, the Indian crypto community has ramped up efforts to influence the government&#x2019;s final decision on the country&#x2019;s crypto policy. Also read: Indian Supreme Court Heard Crypto Case in Depth Today Government Unveils Plan for Crypto Bill The Indian government has been deliberating on the crypto report submitted by an interministerial committee (IMC) tasked with studying all aspects of cryptocurrencies and providing recommendations. The report containing a draft crypto bill was made public on July 22 but the bill has yet to be introduced in parliament. During Thursday&#x2019;s supreme court hearing of the crypto case, the government unveiled its plan regarding the bill. Financial Express publication reported that the government informed the court that the IMC has recommended a &#x201C;complete ban on private cryptocurrencies&#x201D; in India, adding: The Banning of Cryptocurrency and Regulation of Official Digital Currency Bill, 2019, will be introduced in parliament in the next session. An Indian platform for crypto regulatory news and analysis, Crypto Kanoon, reported that the government requested the court to adjourn the crypto case until &#x201C;January as it intends to introduce the bill in parliament in [the] winter session.&#x201D; Lok Sabha, the lower house of the Indian parliament, has three sessions. The winter session takes place in November and December. While the Indian government intends to introduce this bill, Nischal Shetty, CEO of local exchange Wazirx, emphasized that it is not set in stone as the crypto community in India is working tirelessly to convince the government that the bill is flawed. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m sure such a rough draft bill which does not even classify crypto properly will not be presented in parliament,&#x201D; he opined. Even though the supreme court postponed hearing the petitions relating to India&#x2019;s crypto regulation, it heard the writ petitions against the banking restriction by the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) in some detail on Thursday. News.Bitcoin.com previously reported on the RBI hearing which will resume on Aug. 14. As for the petitions concerning the crypto regulation, the court is expected to hear the case in January next year. Bill Seeks to Ban Crypto Constituted on Nov. 2, 2017, under the chairmanship of former Secretary of the Department of Economic Affairs Subhash Chandra Garg, the IMC has representation from the Ministry of Electronics and Information Technology, the RBI, the Securities and Exchange Board of India, and Central Board of Direct Taxes. The committee met three times before submitting its crypto report and draft bill to the Ministry of Finance. The report itself is dated Feb. 28. &#x201C;The committee has recommended a law banning the cryptocurrencies in India and criminalizing carrying on of any activities connected with cryptocurrencies in India,&#x201D; the report reads. Among other prohibitions, the bill states that &#x201C;No person shall mine, generate, hold, sell, deal in, issue, transfer, dispose of or use cryptocurrency in the territory of India.&#x201D; News.Bitcoin.com previously reported on the content of this bill. The finance ministry has confirmed that the report is being examined by relevant regulators. However, Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman recently admitted that she had not spent time on the report but saw a presentation on it and thought that it was a &#x201C;very futuristic and well-thought-out report.&#x201D; Flawed Report, Community&#x2019;s Efforts to Inform Government Since the public release of the IMC report, the Indian crypto community has ramped up efforts to help the government see how flawed the report is, pointing out many areas that indicate the lack of understanding of cryptocurrency and its underlying technology on the IMC part. Sathvik Vishwanath, CEO of local crypto exchange Unocoin, told news.Bitcoin.com that, to his knowledge, there was never any invitation from the government to industry stakeholders to discuss the drafting of this bill. &#x201C;In the draft bill, there are many major flaws,&#x201D; he expressed. &#x201C;They have a wrong understanding of the technology and usage of crypto assets.&#x201D; Shetty has been running a social media campaign called &#x201C;India Wants Crypto&#x201D; which has entered its 282nd day. &#x201C;We&#x2019;re doing everything we can on our end to ensure that the government involves the stakeholders,&#x201D; he shared with news.Bitcoin.com Friday. &#x201C;I&#x2019;m confident the government will set up a standing committee first (even the IMC report recommends that). If the standing committee is set up, we&#x2019;ll see deeper industry participation and this will lead to a more comprehensive and well-planned crypto regulation in India.&#x201D; Elaborating that &#x201C;Behind the scenes, we&#x2019;re meeting elected representatives from all over the country,&#x201D; he added: We want to ensure that our leaders hear our point of view since this whole ban narrative has been created due to a misunderstanding that crypto is here to replace INR. Crypto is more an asset and utility and that&#x2019;s the biggest use case currently prevalent in India. Sumit Gupta, CEO of local crypto exchange Coindcx, also shared some thoughts with news.Bitcoin.com Friday. &#x201C;We are hopeful that the government will consider the case presented by the crypto community and will make an informed decision that is in the best interest for the country,&#x201D; he believes. &#x201C;The Indian crypto community is actively working on sharing across our points to government officials for informed decision making.&#x201D; Further, many think that the Indian government should take into account more recent crypto developments since the report was drafted such as the crypto guidance by the Financial Action Task Force (FATF) and the G20 meetings where India and the finance minister independently declared their commitments to applying the FATF standards. Crypto 101 Kit Sent to Finance Minister Sohail Merchant, CEO of local crypto exchange Pocketbits, announced on Aug. 3 that he had sent a letter to the finance minister along with a &#x201C;crypto 101 kit&#x201D; on behalf of the crypto community in India. &#x201C;The negative public perception of crypto needs to be changed with facts,&#x201D; he tweeted. Sohail Merchant&#x2019;s crypto kit and documents to the Indian finance minister. In his letter, Merchant pointed out that the IMC&#x2019;s ban recommendations &#x201C;are based on the premise that cryptocurrencies lack the characteristics of currency hence cannot be legal tender&#x201D; and that &#x201C;their usage for payments could compete with the use of INR, which could lead to less control over monetary policy.&#x201D; However, Merchant argued that &#x201C;the community has not requested crypto assets to be regulated as legal tender or currency,&#x201D; reiterating: Our request to be considered is that crypto assets can be classified as a commodity or an asset; it is a store of value. As Indian citizens, we want to exercise our right to trade and commerce, which was granted to use by The Constitution of India. Banning Not a Solution The Indian crypto community has been trying to convince the government that banning cryptocurrencies is not a solution. &#x201C;If the ban comes into effect, the black market will continue to thrive. It will be the common man, compliant businesses, and innovators building upon these protocols that will be affected,&#x201D; Merchant wrote in his letter to the finance minister. &#x201C;If a standing committee is constituted to deliberate on regulating crypto assets, we as an industry are willing to work along and help draft a framework,&#x201D; he offered. His letter echoes a statement issued on July 31 by The Indian National Association of Software and Services Companies (Nasscom) regarding the banning of crypto assets. Nasscom is a non-profit information technology industry association self-described as &#x201C;the apex body for the 154 billion dollar IT BPM industry in India.&#x201D; Among its initiatives, the group &#x201C;Liaisons with government and industry to influence a favourable policy framework,&#x201D; its website states. The association said it believes the recent IMC proposal &#x201C;to ban all cryptocurrencies, barring those that are backed by the government, is not the most constructive measure. Instead, the government should work towards developing a risk-based framework to regulate and monitor cryptocurrencies and tokens.&#x201D; This suggestion is in line with the guidance for a risk-based approach to crypto assets and service providers issued by the FATF for in June. Emphasizing that &#x201C;A ban would inhibit new applications and solutions from being deployed and would discourage tech startups&#x201D; and &#x201C;would handicap India from participating in new use cases that cryptocurrencies nad tokens offer,&#x201D; Nasscom reiterated that &#x201C;A ban is more likely to deter only the legitimate operators as they have no intent to be non-compliant.&#x201D; Endorsing her association&#x2019;s stance, Nasscom President Debjani Ghosh tweeted Friday: We cannot close the door on new technologies.

Wright, the technologist who claims to be the pseudonymous creator of bitcoin, Satoshi Nakamoto.\nA redacted declaration filing fromKleiman v. Wrightsurfaced today, which details Wright’s purported ownership and the trustee scheme of the Tulip Trust, which supposedly holds over one million bitcoin. According to the filing, access to the holdings of the trust requires participation of all trustees, at least one of whom he hasn’t been in contact for several years.\nThe court document was originally filed on May 8, and also points to the existence of a second Tulip Trust, known as Tulip Trust II.\nDays before the document was filed, a federal court ordered Wright to disclose his bitcoin addresses in the ongoing lawsuit. Wright is beingsuedby Ira Kleiman on behalf of the estate of his brother, the late Dave Kleiman. The nChain chief scientist is accused of scheming to “seize Dave’s bitcoins and his rights to certain intellectual property associated with the bitcoin technology.”\nKleiman is seeking half of the 1.1 million bitcoins the two are said to have mined together, or its “fair market value,” as well as compensation for infringement of intellectual property. The initial complaint did not seek to ascertain whether Wright is the person behind the Nakamoto identity, stating that “it is unclear whether Craig, Dave and/or both created Bitcoin.”\nAccording to the declaration released Thursday, the Tulip Trust consolidated the bitcoin Wright mined and purchased between 2009 and 2011.\nThe trust first came to public attention through a leakeddocumenton December 9, 2015. Allegedly written in 2011 by Dave Kleiman, a forensic computer investigator and author, the document describes a trust fund containing exactly 1,100,111 bitcoin, “to be managed by at least three people but not more than seven at any time.” The document also declares the bitcoin holding is to be returned to Craig Wright on January 1, 2020.\nThese new developments come amid an ongoing mediation process, which as of June 18 has yielded no results —in the words of the mediator, as reported by attorney Stephen Palley, “we are at an impasse.”\nAs it stands,Wright is due for deposition in Florida on June 28.\nAccording to Wright’s court declaration, seven trustees were named, including Craig Wright, David Kleiman, and Ms. Uyen Nguyen — whom Wright claimed he has had no contact with since 2016. That said, Kleiman was the initial, and sole, trustee before others were appointed.\nPanopticrypt Pty Ltd, an Australian entity now in liquidation was also named alongside an unnamed Seychelles entity and CO1N Ltd., a U.K. entity liquidated in 2017.\n“The contacts at CO1N were Dave Kleiman and Ms Nguyen, who was terminated as director on June 1, 2016. Presently, there is no one other than myself who was a contact for this entity.” Nguyen was allegedly terminated as director of CO1N in June 2016.\nThe final trustee listed is “the holder of PGP key IDs, which is Satoshi Nakamoto,” with Craig Wright parenthetically related.\nIn the past, Wright has said that the trust is encrypted using a a method called Shamir’s Secret Sharing Algorithm. The only way to access them, he’s said, is to accrue the collective private keys in order to decrypt it.\nWright complied with the directive pursuant to a court order to produce bitcoin holdings for all bitcoin Wright mined prior to December 31, 2013. The filings were subsequently sealed.\nThe Tulip Trust II was settled in 2014 in Seychelles with Equator Consultants listed as a trustee. Wright and his wife Ramona Watts are the primary beneficiaries. The holdings of this second trust are unknown.\nWright also hinted at an inaccessible trove of bitcoin mined between 2011 and 2013 by staff at HighSecured and Signia Enterprises under his direction, to be held on behalf of the original Tulip Trust. Wright alleges the principles of HighSecured were arrested in 2015.\nWright has claimed in the past the Tulip Trust is currently inaccessible. In the court document Wright said:\n“Access to the encrypted file that contains the public addresses and their associated private keys to the Bitcoin that I mined, requires myself and combination of trustees reference in Tulip Trust I to unlock based on Shamir scheme.”\nDave Kleiman passed away in 2013. Last December, the courtdeniedWright’s attempt to dismiss the lawsuit, saying that he “converted at least 300,000 bitcoins upon Dave’s death and transferred them to various international trusts.”\nThe court filing can be found below:\n6/20 FilingbyCoinDeskon Scribd\nJustice statue imagevia Shutterstock\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":11445.65,\"take_profit\":12487.16,\"forecast_10d\":[11354.02, 11523.58, 11382.62, 10895.83, 10051.70, 10311.55, 10374.34, 10231.74, 10345.81, 10916.05]}"}

The annual series consists of much more than the highly publicized $10,000 No-Limit Texas Hold ‘em main event.

The following is adapted from his Fintech Blueprint newsletter. The war over money is reaching a new height. And yet, the shape of what is to come has never been more obvious. I can’t tell you how the cookie will crumble yet, but I can tell you the ingredients and the flavor. If you are not preparing for this world, your head is in the sand and you will miss a generational opportunity. Related: Bitcoin Can’t Be a Safe Haven and 100x Leverage Is the Reason Why COVID-19 has made transparent the playbook of sovereign states and their macroeconomic responses. Students of history will know that money has always been an instrument of the State, and that debt is how you build an Empire. To wage war, you must borrow from the Iron Bank. Taxes are the royal lifeblood, and we are economic appendages for the body politic. In this frame, regulatory licensing is the granting of monopoly power over State privilege. Privilege enforced by the sword.

You would bat away at technology upstarts trying to weasel their way into the financial rivers. But sometimes you need to hand out $2 trillion in bailout money for a quarantine that you have mandated. One hand takes, the other hand gives. Sometimes the giving hand allows PayPal, Intuit, and Square to direct money without traditional licensing , because they are faster and more efficient. But sometimes the money runs out and you’ve killed all the small businesses anway. Related: Dutch Central Bank Wants to Be European Union’s CBDC Proving Ground Anyway. The money seems to be doing some weird things these days, if you are a country. Like, some really weird things! For example, the money keeps trying to transform itself into private cash equivalents and hide out in blockchains. Strange new companies, which are definitely not licensed to lend and borrow, keep buying up money, putting it into a box, and launching tokenized versions of units of account. It’s not even clear that it is companies doing this – sometimes it is just a bunch of open source-obsessed strangers on the internet. Story continues About $3 billion of tokenized cash sweep, in large part on the Ethereum blockchain and used in trading and decentralized finance, now sits in crypto exchanges. Tether alone is $7 billion of market capitalization today (not all is on exchanges). This is a sign of people entering the ecosystem to access new financial instruments . Note, these are not investment trends. This is not about a stablecoin ever being worth more than one dollar per unit. Rather, it is about flows and where the money is going. This cash is the rounding error in your asset allocation. Cash should be 5-10 percent of your net worth depending on risk tolerance. Meanwhile, Facebook and Silicon Valley startups with billions of users are also trying to reinvent money. As a country, you may have a few hundred million people here and there. But the technology platforms are global and far better coordinated than international political bodies. They have people’s attentions and hearts; you just have taxes and the sword. If you haven’t seen it yet, the Libra Association released a second version of its white paper reflecting the input of regulators . The initial cut was focused on a technology council that issued a currency basket as an initial reserve, and then tech company users would contribute to that currency basket from across the world. Net interest income would flow to the council, yielding billions as balances reached trillions. The new cut is both more modest, and more dangerous. That is precisely what makes it so dangerous and likely to be adopted. The libra coin will be a mere basket (i.e., an allocation container) of underlying central bank digital currencies represented on the network (for my prior take on CBDCs, see here ). This means there will be a digital dollar, a digital euro and a digital sterling all traveling on the Libra blockchain rails. This is analogous to today’s stablecoins traveling on the Ethereum rails. The white paper update is less ambitious in that it will not create a new form of money, and that the Libra rails will be fully permissioned. There is no decentralization and self-sovereignty in this proposal. And that is precisely what makes...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[43616, 'did-young-satoshi-nakamoto-write-this-1999-cypherpunks-post', 19189, 'Did Young Satoshi Nakamoto Write This 1999 Cypherpunks Post?', '2020-04-21 23:17:00', 'The speculation is rising, but it’s just about impossible to prove.', 'An anonymous post on the Cypherpunks mailing list from 21 years ago discusses the idea of “ecash,” and the speculation in the crypto community is that it might belong to a pre-Bitcoin Satoshi Nakamoto.“Cypherpunk” refers to a movement that emerged in the 1980s advocating cryptography and other privacy-enhancing technologies as tools for promoting social change. Many of the early Bitcoin supporters were part of the Cypherpunks mailing list, including Adam Back, Hal Finney, and Nick Szabo.\\xa0We do not know with any certainty whether Satoshi Nakamoto was ever part of the forum, but he surely would have been familiar with the ideas percolating there. Many of those ideas formed the basis for what Nakamoto ultimately finalized in Bitcoin.When this old post discussing “ecash” resurfaced, it was easy to connect the dots to present-day Bitcoin. Recall that the full name of the Bitcoin whitepaper is “Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System.”The anonymous author of the Cypherpunks post discusses the necessary prerequisites of digital cash, one feature of which is called “blinding:”“I wouldn\\'t say ecash has to use blinding, but I would argue it would be a misuse of the word “ecash\", if something which was revocable were dubbed ecash.”“Blinding” likely refers to the idea of a cryptographic blind signature, introduced by David Chaum. It lets people securely sign data without revealing it, and then verifies that the data has not been tampered with. This functionality has become commonplace in the wake of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies.The author of the anonymous post goes on to discuss another key obstacle that any electronic currency faces: the double spend problem.“One possibility is to make the double-spending database public. Whenever someone receives a coin they broadcast its value. The DB\\xa0 [database] operates in parallel across a large number of servers so it is intractable to shut it down.”He concludes his post by mentioning the two proposals for electronic money that were referenced in the Bitcoin whitepaper: Wei Dai’s b-money and Adam Back’s Hashcash:“Another possible form of ecash could be based on Wei Dai\\'s b-money. This is like hashcash, something which represents a measurable amount of computational work to produce. It therefore can\\'t be forged. This could be a very robust payment system and is worth pursuing further.”In the course of a 200-word post, the anonymous touches on every major issue facing a usable digital currency, and does so 10 years before Bitcoin pulled them all together. It’s certainly not enough to conclude that the author is Satoshi Nakamoto, but the resemblance is striking.\\n'], [43612, 'coronavirus-stimulus-is-more-than-twice-cryptos-all-time-market-cap-high', 4276, \"Coronavirus Stimulus Is More Than Twice Crypto's All-Time Market Cap High\", '2020-04-21 22:36:00', 'The U.S. coronavirus stimulus package dwarfs cryptocurrency’s all-time market cap high by 240%.', 'The U.S government recently unleashed a $2 trillion stimulus package to help Americans offset the economic impact of COVID-19.

A project called Atomic Loans claims to offer a noncustodial bitcoin-backed stablecoin solution, while Money on chain a new smart contract built on the RSK protocol, also offers a stablecoin token. An Attempt to Defi Bitcoin There&#x2019;s been a lot of buzz over the last two years and phrases tossed around like &#x201C;decentralized finance (defi)&#x201D; or &#x201C;open finance.&#x201D; Most of the time, cryptocurrency proponents are talking about the number of defi digital currency projects built on the Ethereum network. Popular defi projects include platforms like Makerdao, Ren, Request Network, Aave, and the Kyber Network. There&#x2019;s been a lot of money tossed at these projects but they are not without controversy, as a number of defi incidents have plagued investors. Just recently news.Bitcoin.com reported on Makerdao users suing the Maker Foundation for over $2.5 million worth of uncollateralized assets. A while back, the open finance project Dforce lost some funds due to a hack, but this week the hacker returned $25 million back to the project. Atomic Loans Cross-Chain Collateralized Loans Now there are developers who are attempting to use BTC&#x2019;s blockchain to create defi projects that deal with lending and stablecoins. The two new projects follow the recent announcement from the creators of the Bitcoin Cash-enforced synthetic derivatives protocol Anyhedge. According to the Anyhedge developers, the project will leverage Cryptophyl&#x2019;s non-custodial exchange, Detoken. The website called atomic.loans is another project looking to offer defi on the BTC chain by providing people with the ability to leverage cross-chain collateralized loans. Essentially, Atomic Loans&#x2019; users allow individuals to borrow ETH-based stablecoins with the ability to lock in BTC as collateral. The Atomic Loans project&#x2019;s Github repository says: &#x201C;In case of default, the collateral is liquidated to make the lender whole. As a fallback for failed liquidations, the lender can eventually seize a portion of the collateral.&#x201D; The Atomic Loans project notes that the team is backed by well known investors like Initialized Capital and Morgan Creek Digital. On April 14, the team announced the project had raised $2.5 million in seed funding from Initialized Capital and other venture capital investors. The creators of Atomic Loans just launched on mainnet and the code is open source for anyone to review. The cross-chain collateralized loan project also has documentation on how the system works and covers topics like cryptocurrency debt instruments, BIP 197 ( Hashed Time-Locked Collateral Contract) and ERC 1850 (Hashed Time-Locked Principal Contract Standard). Money on chain Leverages Rootstock Another project in the realm of defi and BTC is the Money on chain project, which leverages the RSK protocol. The website moneyonchain.com explains how the creators designed a stablecoin and leverage token using a Rootstock or RSK-based (RIF) smart contract. The RSK project is a sidechain that utilizes BTC as the backbone for security. People can access the Money on chain protocol on mainnet right now and research the project&#x2019;s claimed benefits. &#x201C;We provide a Bitcoin-collateralized stablecoin,&#x201D; the website states. &#x201C;Our Bitcoin-collateralized stablecoin uses a trustless, decentralized two-token system.&#x201D; Money on chain thinks that a BTC-collaterized stablecoin can minimize counterparty risk, as the stable token &#x2018;DOC&#x2019; is pegged to the RSK network&#x2019;s RBTC for collateral. The RBTC token is a RSK network token that is pegged to BTC 1:1 and is convertible at any time. Money on chain&#x2019;s token dollar on chain (DOC) is an RRC20 token, that is &#x201C;pegged to the U.S. dollar for risk-averse individuals,&#x201D; the white paper notes. The Money on chain project also has a video on Youtube, which explains how the project functions and the benefits the team claims stablecoins offer. &#x201C;We imagine a world where transactions are instant, cost-efficient and free from the volatility of the current cryptocurrencies markets,&#x201D; the Money on chain creator&#x2019;s vision stresses. &#x201C;We want international trade to be frictionless so individuals and companies can use the Bitcoin blockchain without facing volatility risks.&#x201D; It seems individuals and developers have noticed the popularity of these kinds of projects on the Ethereum chain. During the first week of February, the crypto community celebrated the fact that the total value locked (TVL) in defi applications on the ETH chain surpassed $1 billion. However, after the &#x2018;Black Thursday&#x2019; crypto market massacre on March 12, that value has changed a great deal. What do you think about these two projects?

The Phrase &#x2018;Bitcoin Halving&#x2019; Rises Exponentially on Google Trends Every four years or 210,000 blocks, the network Satoshi Nakamoto created, experiences a block reward halving. When miners hash away at the BTC blockchain they are rewarded fresh coins every ten minutes when they find a block. Today, any miner who happens to find a BTC block gets 12.5 virgin coins that have never been in circulation. After the bitcoin halving in 20 days or on or around May 12, miners will get half the reward and obtain 6.25 BTC per block found. This mathematical and predictable system Nakamoto created, makes it so BTC is scarce and hard to come by going forward. Today BTC&#x2019;s issuance has a per annum inflation rate of around 3.6% but after May 12, the inflation rate will drop to 1.8%. At the time of publication, there is 18,337,650 BTC in circulation and there will only be 21 million BTC issued. With the halving approaching with a quickness, searches about the subject have skyrocketed during the last three weeks. This week (April 19-25), the query for the phrase &#x201C;bitcoin halving&#x201D; is hovering around a 90 out of 100. During the week of April 5-11, the phrase touched an all-time high at 100, which is the highest score a subject can obtain on Google Trends. The reason the upward trend of searches about the bitcoin halving subject is so high is because cryptocurrency participants worldwide are curious about what will happen next. Additionally, while many crypto veterans have experienced two previous halvings, some people are just learning about the subject today. Institutional Investors Interested in the Bitcoin Halving and Great Expectations Recently, a survey conducted by Genesis Mining explained that more than 50% of mining parti...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): [['u/johnfoss68', 'Monero - The Elephant in the Room', 86, '2020-04-21 03:59', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/g56bxi/monero_the_elephant_in_the_room/', '**The state of financial privacy in 2020**\\n\\n*Note: You can read this in a friendlier format with images over on Medium - [https://medium.com/@johnfoss/the-elephant-in-the-room-34e061f5912a](https://medium.com/@johnfoss/the-elephant-in-the-room-34e061f5912a)*\\n\\nThe erosion of personal privacy is gaining momentum since the coronavirus pandemic took hold. Worldwide, there have been numerous calls by governments and social commentators to increase the surveillance of citizens in hope of controlling the virus. Corporations such as Google and Apple, along with countries such as Singapore, Germany, Belgium, USA, and South Korea have been\\xa0utilizing smartphone data\\xa0in different capacities to monitor the movements of citizens.\\n\\nMany believe the implementation of new surveillance measures will calcify and become the new norm, setting precedence for further encroachment.\\n\\nMainstream media has also begun supporting the notion of increased surveillance to serve social and financial needs. A recent\\xa0Bloomberg opinion piece\\xa0discussed the need for increased surveillance, pointing out the financial system we operate within is fractured and inefficient when dealing with wide spread social and economic problems.\\n\\nOnce again, government over-reach of citizens’ privacy is a considered solution to our problems.\\n\\nCountries such as Sweden (which is expected to go entirely cashless by 2023) have been leading the charge in moving to a cashless world, and in Australia the government is preparing to\\xa0ban cash transactions over ten thousand dollars\\xa0in order to increase monitorization.\\n\\nThis road to a cashless society is being sped up by the coronavirus pandemic. There is correlation between countries where ‘cash is king’ and a high number of coronavirus infections. Many retail stores are now too afraid to accept cash due to possible virus transmission, with some\\xa0outright refusing\\xa0to transact with cash.\\n\\nThe erosion of privacy, and the gradual transition from cash to digital financial transactions leads us to murky waters. Will we be able to conduct private financial transactions five to ten years from now?\\n\\nThroughout the past decade, unorthodox individuals turned to Bitcoin in order to transact privately. This led to the inception of popular online darknet markets such as the Silk Road. However, many of the darknet markets proved to be unreliable and short-lived. It soon became apparent to Bitcoin users that Bitcoin is not private, and many of those conducting transactions in relation to darknet markets were identified and prosecuted.\\n\\nBlockchain analytic companies such as Chainanalysis gained traction and suddenly Bitcoin tumblers were found to be ineffective. Blockchain analytic companies take advantage of Bitcoin’s transparent blockchain, analysing data and tracking transaction outputs. The blockchain analytic company then sells this information to cryptocurrency exchanges and government organisations so they can link Bitcoin addresses to specific users. Many Bitcoin advocates tout Bitcoin can be used privately via the use of newer tumbling technologies, however this is a somewhat arduous process with no guarantee of its effectiveness. In December 2019\\xa0Chainanalysis demonstrated\\xa0how they tracked transactions mixed via Wasabi Wallet that were associated with the PlusToken scam. Tumbling also leads to the possibility of coin taint, whereas certain Bitcoin may be perceived to be less valuable because they can be identified as being associated with nefarious activities, and as a result exchange services may confiscate coins when a user attempts to sell them.\\n\\nWhile Bitcoin holds many desirable characteristics of sound money, many prominent figures within the Bitcoin space have repeatedly discussed on the need for default privacy and fungibility. However, as was seen in previous years’ block size dispute, the issue of privacy will come with great lengthy debate as stakeholders attempt to reach a consensus that does not impact upon the characteristics of Bitcoin.\\n\\nAs change within the social and financial landscape continues to accelerate, those seeking financial privacy may turn to Monero.\\n\\nMonero is the elephant in the room.\\n\\nMonero is a cryptocurrency similar to Bitcoin and shares many of the same characteristics of sound money, however it also provides default privacy. Unlike other privacy focused cryptocurrencies, privacy isn’t opt-in, so all transactions and wallet amounts are unknown and indistinguishable from one another. Every unit of Monero is valued equally as no matter its history. This allows Monero to be truly fungible, and eradicates any possibility of coin taint. It has proven this in a number of cases. For example, exchanges have been hesitant to list Monero due to KYC/AML compliance issues it raises because it is impossible to determine transaction history.\\n\\nIf Monero provides financial privacy solutions, why is Monero being ignored?\\n\\nFirstly, while most deem privacy to be important, many are yet to find it necessary to adopt privacy technologies. There are many easy to use privacy solutions such as Signal or DuckDuckGo, however these are not widely used as users opt for convenience instead. As surveillance increases and data collected is harnessed to marginalize or punish users, it is like that privacy technologies will become extremely desirable. Additionally, acquiring Monero can be difficult or inconvenient for some, as cryptocurrency exchanges must comply with laws and regulations, and may perceive it to be a risk listing an untraceable cryptocurrency. This also leads to lower liquidity than other cryptocurrencies.\\n\\nMonero remains a community driven project. Public figures such as John McAfee and Crypto Vigilante continue to advocate the use of Monero ahead of Bitcoin. Due to its humble and open-source nature, Monero isn’t widely promoted even though it maintains the third largest cryptocurrency community on Reddit after Bitcoin and Ethereum.\\n\\nIn respect to the technology, Monero’s hashrate has steadily been increasing over time, and the number of\\xa0daily transactions\\xa0taking place on the Monero blockchain are higher than ever. The Monero Research Lab continues its research in order to improve the protocol. Over the past few years these improvements resulted in reduced transaction fees, and enhanced scalability and privacy.\\n\\nIn just a few years from now, it is extremely likely traditional financial systems will not provide the capacity to transact privately. Banks will be required to ask questions regarding why certain transactions took place, and recorded transaction data will be sold to third parties. As the erosion of our privacy continues to accelerate, it won’t be long until Monero gains the use and recognition it deserves, and price reflects this.\\n\\nMonero is what people think Bitcoin is.\\n\\n\\n*Feel free to share or publish this article as you wish.*', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/g56bxi/monero_the_elephant_in_the_room/', 'g56bxi', [['u/1Tim1_15', 39, '2020-04-21 04:49', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/CryptoCurrency/comments/g56bxi/monero_the_elephant_in_the_room/fo1ns18/', \"Monero is awesome.

BitUniverse, a startup that counts China’s Shunwei Capital and ZhenFund among its backers, has a monthly trading volume of around $5 billion on its online brokerage platform, according to Beijing-based founder Chen Yong. And more than 80% of its 100,000-some users run a grid trading algorithm every day, which automates buy and sell orders at certain regular intervals to capitalize on normal price volatility, Chen said. The cryptocurrency boom of recent years has given birth to major exchange operators like Binance and Huobi -- but brokerage services, which play a major role in traditional financial markets, aren’t much of a presence in the arena. BitUniverse is among a new wave of startups hoping to become a one-stop platform for regular people to trade crypto like Bitcoin and Ether, providing them with the liquidity from a multitude of exchanges. Its algorithms help users place orders 24 hours a day, seven days a week -- which some exchanges offer but is more rare from brokerages. “Trading bots let users overcome their humanity flaws and become a rational investor,” Chen said in a video interview. That doesn’t mean they will be guaranteed to make money, he adds, but they will “at least lose less.” Chen, who co-founded utility app provider Cheetah Mobile Inc., started his crypto venture at the end of 2017. BitUniverse’s Pionex brokerage service launched a year ago and has already become a major cash cow for the firm. BitUniverse, which is incorporated in Singapore, now makes roughly $3 million a month by charging a fee of 0.05% per transaction to traders in places from China to Europe and the U.S, Chen said. About 80% of Pionex’s trades are fulfilled by the order books on Binance and Huobi, he said. In 2018, BitUniverse raised close to $10 million from prominent Chinese venture capital firms Shunwei, ZhenFund and Gaorong Capital at a $50 million valuation, according to the company. Chen runs a team of around 80 people, most of whom are developers hailing from Chinese tech firms including Cheetah, Alibaba Group Holding Ltd. and Baidu Inc., he said.

But they have been doing so under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty. The statement gives the first sign of official clarity on the idea that stablecoins are legitimate representations of value.\nRelated:Blockchain Bites: DeFi Meets NFTs, TSLA Beats Bitcoin in Volatility, Uniswap Breaks $2B\nWhy is this significant for markets?\nTo start with, it signals a growing regulatory acceptance of stablecoins. While fiat-backed blockchain-based tokens have been often talked about in the halls of power, especially after Facebook’s stablecoin project Libra was announced last year, they had not been recognized in an official statement as an acceptable result of financial innovation – until now.\nAnd the U.S. is not the only significant economic bloc to signal acceptance: Earlier this week, the European Central Bank (ECB)issued a reportthat assesses the threats stablecoins could pose. But rather than hint that stablecoins might be in trouble, the report conveys that the ECB isfiguring outhow to mitigate the potential risks.\nThe issue was becoming urgent, given the explosive increase in stablecoin demand. The total value of stablecoins has now surpassed $18 billion, up from $10 billion just four months ago. Much of this growth has been driven by international demand for dollars as well as the increasingly sophisticated financial tools being built on top of public blockchain technology.

In the following post from the same day, Finney announced that he had already written “test code” and uploaded it to the Github repository. However, there was a problem with Finney’s proposal — his method had already been patented by someone else.“Method for Accelerating Cryptographic Operation on Elliptic Curves” (also known as GLV or Four-Dimensional Gallant–Lambert–Vanstone Scalar Multiplication) received a patent on September 19, 2006 — likely at a time when Satoshi Nakamoto was already busy at work on Bitcoin (BTC). In order to understand the invention, we have to dive a bit deeper into elliptical curve cryptography. The patent reads:The improvement comes from representing “the scalar k as a combination of components k, and an integer A”. Mathematical operations performed on k represented in this form appear to be less computationally expensive, hence the gains in speed. Finney’s 2013 proposal was implemented with the release of the libsecp256k1 library, but was never enabled due to existing legal concerns. That's how things stood until September 25, when the patent expired. According to the Blockstream co-founder Adam Back, the code is now expected to be activated in the next Bitcoin Core update.February 2011 seems to be the time when Finney was most focused on optimizing Bitcoin's signature verification. In a post from February 7, 2011, Finney said he was looking at “batch signature verification”, which he believed might speed up the process by a factor of four. The idea behind it was that instead of verifying signatures one by one, to verify them block-wise: hundreds or even thousands at a time. However, according to Blockstream’s co-founder Pieter Wuille (who was one of the authors of the libsecp256k1 library), when GLV is combined with batch verification, the gains disappear once you reach approximately 1,000 signatures:“The benefit of batch+GLV over just batch is less than single+GLV over just single.\\xa0And for very large numbers, the benefit tends to a ratio 1 (so no benefit). But at least up to 1000s of signatures, it is still an advantage.”Indeed, it has been implemented for Schnorr signatures where it affords two-fold gains in speed. Back indicated that he expects a forthcoming release of Schnorr signatures which include batch verification:“Later this year/next year Schnorr signatures released including activation and then batch verification speed up also becomes available.”It is unlikely that Finney’s cryogenic housing allows for any movement, but if it did, we might get a sneak of a smile on his face.\\n\"], [53495, 'price-analysis-9-28-btc-eth-xrp-bch-bnb-dot-link-ada-bsv-cro', 18259, 'Price analysis 9/28: BTC, ETH, XRP, BCH, BNB, DOT, LINK, ADA, BSV, CRO', '2020-09-28 19:16:00', 'Bitcoin and altcoins may hit a few roadblocks in the short-term as they near stiff overhead resistance levels, but the overall trajectory remains bullish.', 'Bitcoin (BTC) soared above $10,000 on July 27 and has sustained above this level since then.

This week bitcoin enthusiasts discussed the possibility of the crypto asset reaching $100k at great length. In mid-December 2017, the price of bitcoin (BTC) touched an all-time high (ATH) of $19,600 per coin. Today, BTC is 45.81% lower than the 2017 ATH but a number of bitcoiners believe that the crypto asset will surpass that price range. For instance, at the 2020 Virtual Blockchain Week event, the well known venture capitalist Tim Draper said he believes the price of BTC will touch $250k by 2022 or early 2023. Mark Yusko the CEO of Morgan Creek said he thinks BTC will reach $100k. Other influencers who believe $100k per BTC is attainable include Blockfyre&#x2019;s Simon Dedic, Cardano&#x2019;s Charles Hoskinson, and Morgan Creek&#x2019;s Anthony (Pomp) Pompliano. This week a great number of average folks leveraging the Reddit forum also discussed the possibility of BTC reaching $100k. The Reddit post called &#x201C;How many people here think 100k is happening at any point?&#x201D; was a topical discussion on Sunday and hundreds of people commented. A deep scan into the thread shows that a great majority of bitcoiners think that $100k is destined to happen. Although, there were a fraction of individuals who did not think BTC could reach the six-digit zone. &#x201C;I think it is inevitable at some point,&#x201D; explained the top comment on Sunday&#x2019;s post. &#x201C;Yep, definitely inevitable. It&#x2019;s just a question of how much time it&#x2019;ll take,&#x201D; an individual responded to the top comment. One person remarked that BTC has a better chance of touching six-digits than going to zero. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s not inevitable, but I do think it will happen,&#x201D; the Redditor wrote. &#x201C;I think if it doesn&#x2019;t go to $100k, it will be near worthless within 5-10 years and that means something else did finally take over. IMHO, it has a better chance of going to $100k than worthless, but I always factor in that chance.&#x201D; A number of other individuals gave reasons to why they think that the crypto asset could reach this psychological price range. A few people compared BTC to the likes of gold and said that the crypto asset will mimic the precious metal&#x2019;s store of value benefits. &#x201C;Just look at the market cap for gold in the trillions, around $9 trillion,&#x201D; the individual stressed. &#x201C;If BTC hit the same market cap that would mean about $485k per currently circulating bitcoin. That&#x2019;s just using this year&#x2019;s numbers. and not counting for lost BTC.&#x201D; The subreddit r/bitcoin is not the only place on the web where individuals are discussing BTC hitting the six-digit range. On Twitter, the $100k per BTC conversation is also very prominent. On September 25, the creator of the stock-to-flow (S2F) bitcoin model, Planb, held a poll about the six-digit price range which received over 24,000 votes. While 34% said BTC will stay below $55k, over 26% said the crypto asset would be $100k and 19.5% voted for $288k per coin. The same day the Twitter user &#x201C;Anasatsia&#x201D; explained that she will be dancing when BTC reaches the $100k region. &#x201C;When Bitcoin hits $100k,&#x201D; she tweeted. &#x201C;I am gonna dance around everyone who said that putting $$$ into bitcoin is a bad idea saying &#x2018;Suckers, suckers, suckers&#x2019;&#x201D; The Bitcoin influencer Michael Goldstein jokingly told his 40,000 followers on Sunday that &#x201C;$100k bitcoins will be more useful than $10k bitcoins.&#x201D; if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); On Friday, Crypto Capital Venture told his 19,000 Twitter followers that $100k will happen but the crypto asset would probably slide back down to $30k. &#x201C;Bitcoin to $100k isn&#x2019;t a final destination,&#x201D; he tweeted. &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a pit stop; a service area where the rest of the world will finally have a chance to say &#x2018;Ok, let me get on board please.&#x2019; &#x2026; And then it&#x2019;ll retrace to $30k.&#x201D; Between a number of Reddit forum posts and Twitter conversations, the belief that BTC will reach six-digits is strong among BTC proponents. The most dominant reasoning behind most individual&#x2019;s beliefs as to why the crypto asset will jump that high is macroeconomics and the central banks&#x2019; fiat creation. Supporters wholeheartedly believe that the price range will happen, it&#x2019;s just a matter of when to most people discussing the subject.

Estimates say that at least $129 million ERC20 tokens affected are considered &#x201C;safe&#x201D; from the hacker&#x2019;s clutches. Additionally, evaluations show the breach may be much larger than originally estimated, as one report says the compromise saw $280 million stolen. The Kucoin hack has been the talk of the town in crypto land these days, as the exchange was hacked on September 25, 2020. News.Bitcoin.com reported on the initial losses estimated to be around $150 million, the day after calculations were up to $200 million. Today, another analyst has stated that the hacker likely stole nearly $280 million during the Kucoin breach. &#x201C;So I did some accounting of the Kucoin hack based on the wallets very likely associated and based on my estimation, there was nearly $280 million of assets stolen, not $150M,&#x201D; said Larry Cermak the Director of Research at the Block Crypto on Monday morning. &#x201C;This would make it the third-largest hack in history and [seven] times larger than the Binance hack last year,&#x201D; Cermak added. One of the biggest conversations this weekend on social media and crypto forums was mostly about ERC20 projects that had figured out ways to reverse the hack or freeze the funds stolen. News.Bitcoin.com already reported on the frozen tether (USDT) for $22 million worth of stablecoins from the ETH and EOS chain. Additionally, the Ocean Protocol paused the project&#x2019;s smart contract as well when the hacker started dumping 10k batches of the Ocean token on Uniswap. But a bunch more ERC20 projects either restarted, froze, or paused their protocols in order to save the tokens from the hacker&#x2019;s dumping. Other token projects that participated in the &#x2018;$129 million re-boot&#x2019; included Kardiachain ($9M), VIDT Datalink ($7M), Velo Labs ($76M), Orion Protocol ($8.5M), Aleph token ($510k), Covest ($520k), NOIA Network ($5M) and more. The projects have since been criticized for not being decentralized and executing rollback not seen since the 2017 DAO hack. &#x201C;History doesn&#x2019;t repeat but it does rhyme,&#x201D; tweeted Jameson Lopp after the ERC20 rollbacks and freezes were revealed. &#x201C;Fascinating to see how rollbacks have evolved since The DAO.&#x201D; The software developer added: If a &#x2018;decentralized&#x2019; project can invalidate stolen tokens then it can invalidate YOUR tokens. Censorship resistance for all or censorship resistance for no one. It&#x2019;s also been said that the Kucoin exchange is working directly with the ERC20 project developers. People visiting the exchange&#x2019;s Telegram channel mentioned that 2 million USDT issued by Tron and Omni Layer was also frozen. Another blockchain project called Akropolis paused all AKRO transfers after the Kucoin hack as well.

The joke, for which I owe a hat tip to Nathaniel Whittemore’s podcast interview with Selgin on The Breakdown , seems especially relevant right now. Demands for COVID-19 fiscal stimulus are driving an increasing number of liberals to embrace MMT’s no-limits position on government spending while hard-money conservatives, disdainful of government expansion, are pouring money into gold as a hedge against runaway inflation and general monetary breakdown. As both extremes garner all the attention, it’s difficult for nuanced, middle-ground voices to be heard. But that middle position is exactly where I’m going with this column, inspired by having just read “ The Deficit Myth ,” the influential new book by MMT’s most prominent advocate, Stephanie Kelton. Related: APIs Will Decentralize CBDCs You’re reading Money Reimagined , a weekly look at the technological, economic and social events and trends that are redefining our relationship with money and transforming the global financial system. You can subscribe to this and all of CoinDesk’s newsletters here . Some of my words might attract scorn from the bitcoin community’s “digital gold bugs,” who tend to view MMT’s suggestion that governments ignore deficits and manage spending by printing money as crazy talk. Unlike them, I think MMT’s take on the relationship between government and money is essentially accurate and that it’s a useful point of understanding in our ongoing debates over how best to deliver economic stimulus in the COVID-19 era. But I’m also going to say that, within the current analog financial system, MMT’s policy prescriptions would be a recipe for disaster. Without the discipline of fiscal responsibility, especially without the political accountability of having to fund spending with unpopular taxes, what’s to stop sovereign money issuers from doing what they’ve done through history and debasing their currency? Story continues As per the arguments in last week’s newsletter about Argentina , the very act of removing fiscal constraints would undermine the thing that matters most for a currency to function: trust. Related: Enterprises Would Use DeFi, if It Weren't so Public The bigger question, then, is what can be done to enhance trust so that unencumbered government spending can be appropriately deployed to encourage sustainable economic prosperity for all citizens. How might cryptocurrency and blockchain tools help? Uncle Sam can’t go bankrupt Kelton and her colleagues get some things right. To start with, they convincingly demonstrate the budget of a sovereign, currency-issuing government is incomparable to that of, say, a household or a company. There is no way for a government to go bankrupt, not in the literal, legal sense. And if its debts are owed in its own currency, there is no reason to expect they won’t be repaid, at least in nominal terms. That basic but important insight exposes the common misconception that governments are constrained by a fixed pool of resources that can only be increased through taxation or borrowing. MMTers say the unique sovereign power of currency issuance renders the idea of nominal funding limits false. Thus, they show the harm done by rigid rules such as balanced-budget requirements and debt ceilings. Kelton argues this misconception stems from traditional economics, which frames the sequencing of government fiscal activity backwards. Taxation is not a mechanism for raising funds for future expenditures but a way for a government to compel people to use the currency that its spending initially brought into existence. Taxation assigns utility, and therefore value, to the currency, she argues. Using the acronyms “TAB(S)” and “S(TAB),” Kelton argues the sequencing is not “taxing and borrowing precede spending” but “spending before taxing and borrowing.” No longer conceived as fundraising tools, taxation and debt issuance should instead be viewed as policy levers for managing income distribution, influencing borrowing rates in credit markets and moderating the overall flow of money in the economy. The third of those goals is critical, MMTers say, because governments must respect the “inflation constraint,” the one thing they view as a real, tangible limit on government expenditure. Far from approaching inflation with reckless abandon, MMTers are obsessive about it. They insist governments be singularly focused on preventing a destructive acceleration in prices from undermining a currency’s store of value and hurting savers at the expense of borrowers. Fine in theory but in practice? So much for theory. The core problem with MMT, as I see it, is that all state agencies, not just central banks, now have to be trusted to fight the inflation bogey. They must measure it, predict it and preemptively stop it. That’s easier said than done. More important, they have to be properly incentivized to do so. Because governments are currently sitting on a mountain of rising debt (see the Global Town Hall below), they’re incentivized to encourage inflation, not fight it. Because debt payments are fixed in nominal terms while incomes and tax revenue vary with changing prices, inflation inherently helps the borrower (in this case the government) and hurts the lender (bondholders). Having inflation as the only constraint exacerbates a principal-agent misalignment. It’s bad enough that government leaders and lawmakers already inoculate themselves from political pressure through gerrymandering and other forms of voter disenfranchisement. Now, without the duty to raise taxes to pay for their spending and with the opportunity to inflate away their debt obligations, it’s easy to imagine a further dereliction of their public duty. All that’s needed for inflation to set in is the wrong message. If people believe their government is going to become profligate, their inflation expectations will get baked into preemptive price rises, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy. The issue, again, comes down to trust. It may well be a myth, per Kelton, that “taxing and borrowing precedes spending.” But that story serves a purpose if it helps people retain trust in their government. After all, as the historian Yuval Harari explains , it’s our capacity to tell stories and organize ourselves around them – not the veracity of those stories per se – that allowed homo sapiens to build civilization and take over the world. An alternative This risk of trust failure means an MMT approach is not viable within our current system of government. It would invite the kinds of monetary problems suffered by Venezuela, Zimbabwe, Argentina and Turkey into relatively stable economies such as the U.S. But what about in an era of central bank digital currencies? Perhaps CBDCs could offer more transparency and accountability to MMT-guided policymakers, allowing them greater expenditure leeway within the bounds of the inflation constraint. The rich data generated by a digital monetary system could help officials better estimate money supply, demand and, importantly, velocity (the rate of exchange) – all factors that contribute to inflation but are traditionally hard to measure. Further, blockchain-based smart contracts could be instituted to automate monetary policy adjustments according to changes in these data inputs. Of course, those automated systems could be overridden by the central bank, most easily if the CBDC is based on a closed, single-authority model. But if the systems are audited by a third party, perhaps by the International Monetary Fund, central banks and the government institutions they answer to would face a difficult political backlash if they were shown to be abandoning the model. In return for the policymaking freedom that MMT affords them, bolder governments might even adopt permissioned or even permissionless blockchains to lock in these contractual systems and demonstrate their commitment to protecting the value of their currency. So, you see, interesting ideas can still flourish in the middle path between the extremes. Bitcoin’s luster grows By Galen Moore, CoinDesk senior research analyst Bitcoin has never looked more like “digital gold” than it does now. Consider: Despite the popularity of the “gold 2.0” narrative, for most of its recent life bitcoin has shown a negative correlation with the price of the yellow metal. If that surprises you, it shouldn’t. Bitcoin is a risk-on asset, a venture bet on a future technology that most people in the world have never used. Unlike most such investments, bitcoin is fairly liquid. It makes sense that in times of crisis, it’s one of the first things sold to raise cash. That’s what happened in March, apparently, and bitcoin’s safe-haven narrative took a hit . Following March 12, bitcoin started to show a stronger correlation to gold. It also moved in tandem with U.S. stocks. “In a crisis, all correlations go to one.” (If you’re sick of hearing that line repeated, you’re not alone.) Look what’s happened in the past two months. Bitcoin’s positive correlation to gold is stronger and more consistent than it has ever been, at any time in the past. And its correlation to the S&P 500 is falling back into non-correlated territory. It’s one thing to say bitcoin has potential as an inflation hedge. It’s another to be actually looking hard for the inflation hedge with the highest potential earnings out there. Notably, this week, as overbought gold saw a correction, bitcoin held strong. The rest of Q3 will either jumble bitcoin’s “digital gold” narrative again, or will solidify bitcoin (market cap $216 billion) as a contender against gold, an asset that has a valuation in the trillions.

Despite the bullish narrative surrounding the halving, however, the event by itself does not necessarily guarantee Bitcoin’s price appreciation. If the reduced supply of new BTC is not accompanied by significant demand, prices are unlikely to surge.\\xa0Also, the halving is an entirely predictable event, meaning all market participants know in advance when it will occur. Therefore, its current price may already reflect the halving’s impact before it happens. “Things that we most anticipate generally don’t happen,” said Bloomberg analyst Mike McGlone, commenting on the much-anticipated event. “And that's what I’m concerned about. It’s complete consensus,” he continued.Also, each time the halving occurs, its impact on the new Bitcoin supply decreases; and over time, its impact will eventually become irrelevant, he argued.

', '                 The Pareto principle, explained              The Pareto principle emphasizes how crucial it is to identify key players, major cryptocurrency or influential projects.According to the Pareto principle, commonly referred to as the 80/20 rule, roughly 80% of outcomes result from 20% of causes. Vilfredo Pareto, an economist from Italy, observed that 20% of the population in Italy controlled 80% of the country’s land at the beginning of the 20th century.\\xa0Since then, this principle has been employed in many different sectors over the years and is frequently invoked to highlight the uneven distribution of results. But what does the 80/20 rule mean for blockchain technology?In the context of cryptocurrencies, the Pareto principle can be observed in several ways:Blockchain network securityA small percentage of nodes — usually around 20% — carry the bulk of the computational workload for network security, safeguarding the integrity and safety of the whole blockchain network. These nodes, which are frequently run by significant entities, contribute disproportionately to preserving the stability of the network.Wealth distributionA small percentage of wallet addresses possess the vast majority of the coins for several cryptocurrencies. This small group of investors, often referred to as “whales,” can significantly influence the market due to their substantial holdings. The 80/20 rule is in line with this wealth concentration.Project successThe vast majority of investor interest and investment in the realm of initial coin offerings (ICOs) and token launches goes to a relatively small number of projects. The 80/20 rule of success is a result of investors concentrating their capital on businesses with strong teams, original concepts and promising technologies.Smart contracts usageThe major...\n- Bitcoin News: [[613243, '2023-10-19 22:30:23', 'Tesla Maintains $184M Bitcoin Holdings as Elon Musk Flags Concerns Over High Interest Rates', 'tesla-maintains-184m-bitcoin-holdings-as-elon-musk-flags-concerns-over-high-interest-rates', 'Kevin Helms', 'Tesla&#x2019;s third-quarter financial statement reveals that the electric car company has not sold any of its bitcoin.

Elon Musk, Mark Cuban Back Case Against SEC Tesla CEO Elon Musk, Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban, and several others jointly filed an amicus brief to the Supreme Court on Wednesday, expressing support in a case that contests the validity of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC)&#8217;s administrative proceedings. The billionaires&#8217; amicus brief was joined by Phillip Goldstein, Nelson Obus, Manouch Moshayedi, and the Investor Choice Advocates Network (ICAN). The Supreme Court is scheduled to hear the SEC v. Jarkesy case on Nov. 29. The case challenges the constitutionality of the SEC&#8217;s use of in-house judges. Plaintiff George Jarkesy argued that the SEC&#8217;s internal, juryless adjudication process by a commission-appointed administrative law judge is unconstitutional because it violates his Seventh Amendment right to a trial by jury. The amicus brief notes that the SEC began handling more cases internally between 2013 and 2014, after suffering &#8220;a series of jury trial losses in insider trading cases.&#8221; The filing states that amici have an interest in the outcome of this case because they believe: It is important that the SEC not be permitted to pick and choose whether parties are granted their constitutional right to jury trials or are forced to proceed in enforcement proceedings with administrative law judges (ALJs) immune from proper and meaningful oversight. &#8220;Unlike defendants in federal court proceedings, respondents in SEC administrative proceedings are not afforded the right to a jury trial or the benefits and protections of the federal rules of evidence and procedure,&#8221; the filing explains. The Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals found in May 2022 that Jarkesy&#8217;s Seventh Amendment rights to a jury trial were violated. This ruling shortly followed the SEC acknowledging in April 2022 that its staff had improperly accessed documents in dozens of cases, including Jarkesy&#8217;s case. Justice Department Solicitor General Elizabeth Prelogar contends the appeals court &#8220;erred in holding that Congress violated the Seventh Amendment by authorizing the SEC to bring administrative proceedings seeking civil penalties&#8221; and that the Supreme Court should reverse course. The Biden administration is asking the Supreme Court to overturn the ruling, stating that it could have “massive practical consequences” across the federal government if left intact. The attorneys for Musk and Cuban asserted that the SEC &#8220;administrative proceedings — as they are currently structured — results in unequal results for SEC defendants.&#8221; They added: The SEC&#8217;s insistence on administrative proceedings when federal court juries are readily available runs contrary to the SEC&#8217;s mission and harms the very investors and markets the SEC is charged with protecting. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); &#8220;In the statutes and regulations the SEC is responsible for enforcing (as well as through its own actions, public statements, and admissions), the SEC demands full transparency and disclosure for the benefit of participants in securities markets,&#8221; the lawyers for Musk and Cuban described. However, the securities regulator &#8220;uses administrative proceedings, without the rigor and deliberation resulting from a jury trial, to litigate against defendants when the SEC could more efficiently and openly litigate in federal court,&#8221; they noted. Moreover, they alleged: &#8220;When the SEC elects to use an administrative proceeding, whether before an ALJ or the commissioners of the SEC, the SEC itself is the sole fact finder and determines a respondent’s liability and punishment without the involvement of a jury.&#8221; In conclusion, Musk, Cuban, and other amici &#8220;urge the court to affirm the Fifth Circuit’s decision but reverse its order of remand to the Commission,&#8221; the filing reveals. Their lawyers wrote: Accordingly, amici &#8230; urge this court to endorse the Fifth Circuit’s reasoning to ensure that the SEC is required to appropriately litigate in all circuits, not just the Fifth Circuit. Musk recently predicted a &#8220;comprehensive overhaul&#8221; of the SEC with 100% probability. The regulator sued the Tesla CEO this month to force him to testify about his acquisition of social media platform Twitter, now known as X.

But as of late in the last five days, the TGA had nothing to do with bitcoin's outperformance,” Mark Connors, head of research at 3iQ, told CoinDesk in a note. “There's a little more confidence that the bitcoin thesis is not just intact, but it's been validated at a level that we've never seen before.”\nConnors says this is a question of confidence for the Federal Reserve.\n“When you see the Fed creating a bubble, popping the bubble and then not knowing which game to play by inflation, or stabilize financial markets, it does not instill confidence,” he continued.\nA bigger question at hand is rate volatility, according to Connors, and the market hates uncertainty.\n“The reason that's important is because rates are used to price every asset on the planet,” he said. “And when you have uncertainty on interest rates, you have uncertainty on what everything is worth.”\nThe next meeting of the Fed's rate-setting Federal Open Market Committee is scheduled to take place March 21-22.\n[{\"Asset\": \"Gala\", \"Ticker\": \"GALA\", \"Returns\": \"\\u221213.7%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Entertainment\"}, {\"Asset\": \"Avalanche\", \"Ticker\": \"AVAX\", \"Returns\": \"\\u221210.6%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Smart Contract Platform\"}, {\"Asset\": \"Loopring\", \"Ticker\": \"LRC\", \"Returns\": \"\\u221210.3%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Smart Contract Platform\"}]\nBitcoin, Ether Volatility Stuns Bears and Bulls Alike\nBy: Shaurya Malwa\nHigher-than-usual market volatility affected bulls and bears alike as crypto futures racked up $300 million in liquidations over a 24-hour period on Wednesday.\nLiquidation refers to when an exchange forcefully closes a trader's leveraged position due to a partial or total loss of the trader's initial margin. It happens when a trader is unable to meet the margin requirements for a leveraged position (fails to have sufficient funds to keep the trade open).\nLarge liquidations can signal the local top or bottom of a steep price move, which may allow traders to position themselves accordingly.\nBitcoin and ether briefly inched above $26,000 and $1,770 respectively on Tuesday as investors brushed off the long-term effects of a regulatory clampdown on crypto-friendly banks and U.S. consumer price index (CPI) data pointed to slowing inflation in the coming months.\nBitcoin's weekly chart shows the cryptocurrency is again struggling to establish a foothold above $25,000, which capped gains last month and in August 2022. According to chartered market technician Aksel Kibar, a breakout above $25,000 would shift focus to the next hurdle at $28,600. \"All About Bitcoin\" host Christine Lee breaks down the \"Chart of the Day.\"\nBut the euphoria was short-lived as both major tokens dipped as much as 5% from Tuesday's highs before gradually stabilizing. In Asian morning hours on Wednesday, bitcoin traded just under $25,000 while ether traded slightly over $1,700.\nThe volatility caused over $140 million in bitcoin futures and $80 million in ether futures to take on losses. Of this, 58% of futures losses came from shorts, or bets against price rises, while the remaining came from longs, or bets on price rises – meaning both short sellers and long traders were hit almost equally.\nAmong other major tokens, futures on Conflux's CFX tokens and Filecoin's FIL had $8 million and $5 million in liquidations, respectively, as trading volumes for both surged on fundamental developments.\nMeanwhile, some market observers said the price action came as investors looked for alternative assets following last week's collapse of Silicon Valley Bank.\n\"Bitcoin's rally to a new yearly high as Silicon Valley Bank falls and inflation remains stubborn shows that investors are looking to bitcoin for stability in highly uncertain market conditions,\" Alex Adelman, co-founder of bitcoin rewards app Lolli, told CoinDesk.\n\"While many have looked to bitcoin as a hedge against inflation and tracked its price moves accordingly, bitcoin's relationship to traditional finance is more complex,\" Adelman stated, adding that bitcoin worked as an \"alternative to the traditional financial system at large.\"\n\"Weakness across the banking sector has heightened investor awareness of bitcoin's unique value proposition. In the coming weeks, we will continue to see increased demand for bitcoin as a superior system for holding and moving money securely,\" Adelman said.\n8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(00:30 UTC)Australia Unemployment Rate s.a.(Feb)\n12:30 p.m. H1HKT /SGT(4:30 UTC)Japan Industrial Production (YoY/Jan)\n9:15 p.m. HKT/SGT(13:15 UTC)European Central Bank Monetary Policy Decision Statement\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of\"First Mover\"onCoinDesk TV:\nBitcoin Dominance Reaches 9-Month High; Lender Says Silvergate Wasn't Cut Off From Loans\nThe bitcoin (BTC) dominance rate has climbed amid increasing turbulence in crypto markets, according to TradingView data.

Prices as of about 4 p.m. ET Bitcoin Returns to Its Winning Ways By James Rubin After dipping early Thursday, bitcoin surged back to its most recent foothold comfortably above $21,000. The largest cryptocurrency by market capitalization was recently trading at about $21,190, up 1.6% over the past 24 hours, as investors shrugged off the latest fallout from disgraced crypto exchange FTX and conflicting economic data. BTC continued on the more upbeat path throughout 2023. \"Bitcoin is finding support ahead of the $20,000 level,\" Edward Moya, senior market analyst for foreign exchange market maker Oanda, wrote in an email. \"The crypto space is getting cleaned up and as long as we don’t see a major reputable exchange go under, traders may mostly shrug off news of the demise of smaller crypto companies.\" Ether followed a similar trajectory, falling early before landing in the green. The second-largest crypto in market value was recently changing hands above $1,550, a 1.9% gain from Wednesday, same time. Other major cryptos also pointed largely upward, with CRO, the token of exchange Crypto.com , jumping more than 4%, and ATOM, the native crypto of decentralized network Cosmos rising over 3%. The CoinDesk Market Index (CDI), an index measuring cryptos' performance, recently increased by 2%. Cryptos veered from equity markets, which continued their losing streak this week, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq dropping 1% and the S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) each falling the better part of a percentage point. Investors tried to reconcile the release of jobs data indicating that the hot job market had not cooled – a 15,000 weekly decrease in Americans filing for unemployment – with declines in housing starts and building permits. The former suggested the economy is not cooling enough to satisfy central bankers and bodes poorly for crypto, while the latter indicated the reverse. Story continues \"Crypto markets still appear to be operating within a “good economic news equals bad news for asset prices” landscape,\" CoinDesk analyst Glenn Williams wrote . Meanwhile, the new head of FTX raised the previously unlikely prospect of FTX exchange reviving, according to an interview he gave to The Wall Street Journal , his first since taking over at FTX in November. CEO John J. Ray III said that despite the accusations of criminal misconduct against former CEO Sam Bankman-Fried and other executives, customers have lauded FTX's technology and said it could be worth reviving the exchange. “Everything is on the table,” Ray told the Journal. “If there is a path forward on that, then we will not only explore that, we’ll do it.” Biggest Gainers Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector XRP XRP +3.6% Currency Terra LUNA +3.6% Smart Contract Platform Cosmos ATOM +3.6% Smart Contract Platform Biggest Losers Asset Ticker Returns DACS Sector Decentraland MANA −0.9% Entertainment Solana SOL −0.1% Smart Contract Platform Insights Asset Management Firm Cobo Looks to CeFi for Inspiration By Shaurya Malwa Cobo, a Singapore-based crypto asset management and custodian platform, is trying to change a key feature of the crypto industry by adopting core tenets of traditional markets – the use of separate custodian, clearing and settlement services for trading. The separation is a longstanding model in the traditional financial industry. These functions, typically handled by different independent entities, help increase transparency and reduce the risk of fraud and misconduct. This in turn helps to build trust among market participants and contributes to the overall integrity and stability of the financial system. In the crypto world, however, these functions are combined under one roof by centralized exchanges (CEX). Unlike traditional stock exchanges, crypto CEXs do more than just match buyers and sellers. They custody and control client funds, act as a counterparty to trades and also provide lending/borrowing services, all with little regulatory oversight. Instead of being a neutral party to transactions, this multifaceted role of CEXs raises major conflict-of-interest issues. FTX’s dramatic demise offered powerful evidence that CEXs should not dominate all these functions and hold that much power over other market participants. Investors turn to custodians With all the uncertainties in CEXs, investors turn to custodians. In November 2019 , Cobo was the first custodian to introduce the Loop network – an off-chain settlement network that allows all parties in the Loop to transfer and settle instantly, without fees. Cobo has now upgraded the Loop network, and this week, launched Superloop, an off-exchange custodian and settlement network that allows traders to trade directly on supported exchanges, with credit secured by collateral held under Cobo’s custody, locked only before the trade. “In this time of uncertainty, it is extremely important for custodians and exchanges to provide a sense of security and trust towards traders,” Jiang Changhao, chief technology officer and co-founder of Cobo, told CoinDesk. “SuperLoop provides this trust by ensuring that traders have full control over their assets while trading among exchanges,” he added. Investors and organizations can make use of Multi-Party Computation (MPC) custody systems to co-manage their funds with an independent custody platform, and at the same time, trade these funds on crypto exchanges that are integrated with clearing and settlement networks hosted by that custody platform. Cobo’s SuperLoop minimizes counterparty risk by removing the need to pre-fund on exchanges before trading and maximizes capital efficiency by enabling funds to be deployed without the delays and risks of on-chain transfers, providing users with full control over their assets.

Additionally, ChinaAMC's spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs have gathered $123.61 million in combined assets, according to Eric Balchunas, senior ETF analyst at Bloomberg.\nHowever, the value of assets garnered by Hong Kong's crypto ETFs pales in comparison to their counterparts in the United States. During their debut week, US spot Bitcoin ETFs attracted nearly $4 billion in assets under management, with a trading volume of $4.5 billion on the first day of trading alone. Eric Balchunas cautioned against setting high expectations for the Hong Kong market, but noted the significance of the local numbers. ChinaAMC's Bitcoin ETF, for instance, gathered $123 million on its first day, ranking it 6th out of 82 ETFs launched in the past three years in Hong Kong and in the top 20% overall.\nOne notable feature of Hong Kong's crypto ETFs is that non-Hong Kong nationals can also subscribe to or purchase units in the ETFs if they meet local regulatory requirements. Moreover, these ETFs allow investors to subscribe to units directly using BTC and ETH, and vice versa, which is not available with their US counterparts.\nA survey conducted by Hong Kong-regulated crypto exchange OSL on April 28 revealed that 76.9% of crypto-knowledgeable respondents in the city plan to invest in the newly introduced spot Bitcoin and Ether ETFs.

Ray III is pushing back against his disgraced predecessor Sam Bankman-Fried’s claims that customers lost “zero” money in the exchange’s 2022 collapse, calling them “categorically, callously, and demonstrably false.”\nIn a victim impact statement penned by Ray on behalf of FTX and its subsidiaries, Ray told New York District Court Judge Lewis Kaplan that Bankman-Fried’s “delusional” claims that his exchange was solvent are a “mischaracterization” of the estate’s January statement that they expect topay customers back in full.\nBankman-Fried and his legal team have leaned heavily on the estate’s recovery, arguing in his February sentencing submission that the “harm to customers, lenders, and investors is zero” and, as such, Judge Kaplan should consider a maximum sentence of 6.5 years in prison – far less than the 40-50 year sentence recommended by prosecutors or the 100 year sentence suggested by the probation department.\nBut just because the FTX estate was able to scrape together enough money to pay back the exchange’s customers – massively aided by the run-up in bitcoin’s price as well as the “tens of thousands of hours…spent digging through the rubble of Mr. Bankman-Fried’s sprawling criminal enterprise to unearth every possible dollar, token, or other asset” – does not mean that Bankman-Fried’s behavior was not criminal, Ray argued.\nRay told the court that, when he took over, the exchange’s coffers were nearly empty – a mere 105 bitcoins remained on the platform, compared with the nearly 100,000 bitcoins customers were entitled to.\nSome of the lost assets were recovered, Ray said, while others, including bribes to Chinese officials and the “hundreds of millions of dollars” Bankman-Fried spent on various investments or buying access to celebrities and politicians are gone for good.\n“The harm was vast. The remorse is nonexistent,” Ray wrote in the Wednesday court filing. “Effective altruism, at least as lived by Sam Bankman-Fried, was a lie.”\nRay told the court that, despite the current plan to get their money back, many of FTX’s customers remain “extremely unhappy” with the valuation of their funds.\nBecause customers will be refunded based on the value of their portfolios at the time of the bankruptcy – not today’s much higher value – they will “never be returned to the same economic position they would have been in today absent [Bankman-Fried’s] colossal fraud,” Ray argued.\nIn their own victim impact statements filed earlier this week, dozens of FTX customers detailed theemotional and financial tollthe exchange’s collapse had on their personal lives.\n“There should be no delusion that because assets have increased in value or that the professionals have been able to recover funds and assets taken or stolen from the estate, that there was no need [to file for bankruptcy],” Ray wrote. “Make no mistake; customers, non-governmental creditors, governmental creditors, and non-insider stockholders have suffered and continue to suffer.”\nBankman-Fried is scheduled to be sentenced on March 28.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"HOLD\",\"confidence\":14,\"stop_loss\":58308.57,\"take_profit\":62965.14,\"forecast_10d\":[59123.43, 62889.84, 63891.47, 64031.13, 63161.95, 62334.82, 61187.94, 63049.96, 60792.78, 60793.71]}"}

A Texas jury has ordered conspiracy theorist and Infowars owner Alex Jones to pay the parents of a Sandy Hook shooting victim $4.1 million in compensatory damages and $45.2 million in punitive damages Jones has spent almost a decade arguing that the 2012 shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School  which left 28 people, including 20 children, dead  was a hoax, and that the parents of the victims were crisis actors upholding the lie. One set of parents, Scarlett Lewis and Neil Heslin, sued Jones and his company, Free Speech Systems, in 2018 for defamation. In a verdict signed by 10 members of the 12-member jury, the group ordered Jones to pay a total of $49.3 million in damages to Lewis and Heslin. It seems so incredible to me that we have to do this, Lewis said at the trial, speaking directly to Jones. That we have to implore you  not just implore you, punish you  to get you to stop lying  It is surreal what is going on in here. Lewis said she felt hitting Jones with monetary damages was necessary because she believed it would be the only thing to get him to change his behavior. In the lead up to the jurys decision, Jones claimed that any judgement for more than $2 million would leave him in financial ruin. His company, Free Speech Systems, also filed for bankruptcy in an effort to limit his financial liability. However, just a day before the jury settled on a number for compensatory damages, it was revealed that Jones lawyers accidentally emailed the full contents of his phone to the attorneys representing Lewis and Heslin, providing dozens of emails and texts that contradicted Jones claims about Infowars profitability. Specifically, the emails revealed that at its peak Infowars had generated as much as $5 million in revenue per week. Plus, Jones supporters recently rallied around the embattled host by donating upwards of $8 billion in Bitcoin. Story continues Throughout the case, Jones also repeatedly asserted that he had no text messages about Sandy Hook to turn over during the discovery process. The phone did in fact contain messages related to Sandy Hook, suggesting that Jones had committed perjury. To make Jones legal troubles even worse, Mark Bankston, the lawyer who represents Lewis and Heslin, said Jones phone contained texts with Trump associate Roger Stone, and that he had heard from various federal agencies and law enforcement about the material. One such agency was the US House committee investigating the January 6th insurrection. The committee first subpoenaed Jones in November, demanding documents related to the conservative figures efforts to spread misinformation about the 2020 election. In the subpoena letter, Rep. Bennie Thompson said Jones helped organize the January 6th rally at the Ellipse that preceded the insurrection, encouraged his listeners to attend the rally, and urged them to march from the park to the Capitol, where Trump was said to speak. Bankston said he planned to turn over the data from Jones phone to the committee. Lewis and Heslin are just one set of Sandy Hook parents with ongoing lawsuits against Jones. Two more trials are expected to begin in Texas in the coming months, while a group of families in Connecticut  won a default judgment against the radio host after he failed to comply with the discovery process.

His company, Free Speech Systems, also filed for bankruptcy in an effort to limit his financial liability. However, just a day before the jury settled on a number for compensatory damages, it was revealed that Jones lawyers accidentally emailed the full contents of his phone to the attorneys representing Lewis and Heslin, providing dozens of emails and texts that contradicted Jones claims about Infowars profitability. Specifically, the emails revealed that at its peak Infowars had generated as much as $5 million in revenue per week. Plus, Jones supporters recently rallied around the embattled host by donating upwards of $8 billion in Bitcoin. Story continues Throughout the case, Jones also repeatedly asserted that he had no text messages about Sandy Hook to turn over during the discovery process. The phone did in fact contain messages related to Sandy Hook, suggesting that Jones had committed perjury. To make Jones legal troubles even worse, Mark Bankston, the lawyer who represents Lewis and Heslin, said Jones phone contained texts with Trump associate Roger Stone, and that he had heard from various federal agencies and law enforcement about the material. One such agency was the US House committee investigating the January 6th insurrection. The committee first subpoenaed Jones in November, demanding documents related to the conservative figures efforts to spread misinformation about the 2020 election. In the subpoena letter, Rep. Bennie Thompson said Jones helped organize the January 6th rally at the Ellipse that preceded the insurrection, encouraged his listeners to attend the rally, and urged them to march from the park to the Capitol, where Trump was said to speak. Bankston said he planned to turn over the data from Jones phone to the committee. Lewis and Heslin are just one set of Sandy Hook parents with ongoing lawsuits against Jones. Two more trials are expected to begin in Texas in the coming months, while a group of families in Connecticut  won a default judgment against the radio host after he failed to comply with the discovery process.

Kraken CEO Jesse Powell ruffled feathers in June after a New York Times article detailed a “corporate culture war” raging at the cryptocurrency exchange and his subsequent doubling down, in which he criticized the “woke activist movement” and told unhappy employees to quit. But then something interesting happened. Most people inside Kraken and many in the broader crypto sphere sided with Powell. Job applications flooded the company. Now, six weeks later, less than 1% of Kraken’s employees have taken the severance package offered to anyone who didn’t want to get with the program. There are at least two ways to interpret this outcome. One is that it revealed the true preferences of a majority of workers at the exchange, and perhaps those of people in the broader crypto industry. Kraken, from this perspective, represented a rare refuge from what Powell later described as “this contingent of people who basically [think] if you don’t agree with them you’re evil, you’re a Nazi, and you must be destroyed at all costs.” At least one workplace remained where coders could just code, leaving politics at the door – and such an oasis had proven beneficial for recruitment and retention. “The pendulum is starting to swing back the other way,...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[91190, 'amid-miner-capitulation-hut-8-maintained-btc-hodl-strategy-in-july', 9614, 'Amid miner capitulation, Hut 8 maintained BTC ‘HODL strategy’ in July', '2022-08-06 20:34:24', 'Other Bitcoin miners such as Core Scientific, Argo Blockchain and Riot Blockchain have reduced their BTC holdings during the bear market.

After all, an NFT is a unique, digital receipt to prove ownership of a purchase that lives on a blockchain. Surely artists would want to prove ownership of the art at which they toiled away?Lena poses with one of her art pieces. Source: JustlenasartLena, a Bitcoin artist who recently moved from Germany to crypto-friendly Dubai, began creating, painting and printing Bitcoin artworks after diving down the Bitcoin rabbit hole in 2018. She said that while she started her crypto career as a crypto-agnostic, Bitcoin changed her approach and eventually took over. She now operates a Bitcoin “maxi-style” portfolio:“My mindset shifted and I began to work on myself, asking myself what to do with my lifetime because of Bitcoin. Bitcoin became like a lifestyle, so I should put all my savings in Bitcoin.”When speaking with people in the crypto community, she explains she’s a Bitcoin artist, to which crypto-lovers ask, “Oh, so you do NFTs?” She told Cointelegraph she replies with, “No! Physical art!”“OpenSea is full of art that is like not art — I mean, art is always up to the person, but it was too much for me.”However, countless artists make a living generating AI artwork and selling or minting them as NFTs on platforms such as OpenSea. The biggest stories of 2021 involved collective cartoon chimps — Bored Ape Yacht Club — and CryptoPunks, further digitally rendered images or art.In the 2022 bear market, the hype around NFTs has reportedly evaporated. Yet, big name brands such as Starbucks continue to hop on the bandwagon, while luxury jeweler Tiffany caused a 1,700% increase in trading volume following an NFT move in August.

Binance&#8217;s Warning: Transfer Your Funds The conflict between global crypto exchange Binance and Indian crypto exchange Wazirx has deepened. Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao (CZ) tweeted Friday, advising anyone with funds on Wazirx to transfer them to Binance. He warned: &#8220;We could disable Wazirx wallets on a tech level.&#8221; The dispute between Binance and Wazirx began when India&#8217;s Directorate of Enforcement (ED) froze the bank assets of Wazirx as part of its money laundering investigation.

However, CZ argued: &#8220;The Wazirx founding team maintained control of the operations of the platform. We (Binance) were never given data or control of users, KYC, etc.&#8221; Responding to Shetty&#8217;s tweet about Binance owning Wazirx, Zhao stressed: We do NOT have control of the trading system. You just gave the AWS login, no source code, no deployment capability. You also retained access to the AWS account, source code, deploy, etc. In a follow-up tweet, CZ claimed that Wazirx has been uncooperative with Binance, adding that the exchange appears to be uncooperative with the ED as well. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Regarding the ED&#8217;s investigation, Shetty tweeted that Zanmai Labs, the entity that owns Wazirx, &#8220;has been cooperating with ED for over 7 days and has submitted all the required data.&#8221; Wazirx also tweeted: We have been fully cooperating with the Enforcement Directorate (ED) for several days and have responded to all their queries fully and transparently.

(REUTERS) The huge sell-off in the cryptocurrency markets sent the price of Bitcoin plummeting a further 10% overnight, taking it down to £16,653, while Ethereum dropped 16% to £846. The crypto crash has now wiped off over £300 billion from the combined value of crypto assets in the past seven days alone, according to data from CoinMarketCap. It has prompted crypto exchange businesses to take drastic action to stifle further losses and stay afloat. Yesterday, US-based cryptocurrency exchange platform Coinbase announced it would be laying off over 1,000 employees to manage operating expenses in response to current market conditions and ongoing business prioritisation efforts. The stock has tanked 86% since its peak in November, wiping £68 billion off its market cap. On Monday, cryptocurrency exchange platform Binance temporarily suspended Bitcoin withdrawals, while crypto lender Celsius Network announced it was suspending withdrawals and transfers between accounts because of extreme market conditions. We are taking this action today to put Celsius in a better position to honour, over time, its withdrawal obligations, the company said in a statement. Shares in US business MicroStrategy have fallen 24% since Friday as investors feared the company faced a margin call on a $205 million loan it had taken out to buy more Bitcoin. In May, the company suggested the call would take effect if the Bitcoin price dropped below $21,000, meaning it could have to sell off some crypto holdings to meet the call. The firm has bought almost 130,000 Bitcoins at an average price of $30,700, causing it to have made a paper loss of almost $1 billion. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: Red lines on a chart belie the financial pain which this loss of value is set to cause for millions of crypto holders. At a time when costs are escalating all over the place, nursing a big hole in a crypto wallet is the last blow they need. Story continues The steep drop in crypto prices began on Friday after figures released by the US Department of Labor showed US inflation hit a 40-year high of 8.6% in May, led by rising food and energy prices. The announcement triggered a mass sell-off in Bitcoin and Ethereum, as investors spooked by rising prices ditched riskier assets in favour of safe havens. El Salvador finance minister Alejandro Zelaya was forced to defend his government against concerns raised over the countrys fiscal stability after it was estimated to have lost at least $40 million from its decision to buy more than 2,300 Bitcoin since September. Zelaya said: The fiscal risk is extremely minimal $40 million does not even represent 0.5% of our national budget.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":42,\"stop_loss\":22398.17,\"take_profit\":24180.46,\"forecast_10d\":[23175.89, 23809.49, 23164.32, 23947.64, 23957.53, 24402.82, 24424.07, 24319.33, 24136.97, 23883.29]}"}

According to the amendment: The Guggenheim Macro Opportunities Fund may seek investment exposure to bitcoin indirectly through investing up to 10% of its net asset value in Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC), a privately offered investment vehicle that invests in bitcoin. To the extent the Fund invests in GBTC, it will do so through the Subsidiary. Given the fund has net assets of $4.97 billion, according to Fidelity, it means mean the fund can invest up to $497 million in GBTC.

Although there have been discussions among lawmakers to treat bitcoin as taxable property, it is not yet official. Different courts have, therefore, made their own decisions whether to recognize the cryptocurrency as property. In July, a Russian court denied a crypto owner the return of his cryptocurrencies, including bitcoin. The court judged that since bitcoin was not considered property under Russian law, its theft was not a crime. In December last year, the supreme court ruled that tokens were assets like money and property. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Russia will begin regulating cryptocurrency next year; President Vladimir Putin signed the crypto bill into law in August.

Centralized exchanges have been the backbone of the cryptocurrency market for years. They offer fast settlement times, high trading volume, and continually improving liquidity. However, there&#x2019;s a parallel world being built in the form of trustless protocols. Decentralized exchanges (DEX) require no middlemen or custodians to facilitate trading. Due to the inherent limitations of blockchain technology, it has been a challenge to build DEXes that meaningfully compete with their centralized counterparts. Most DEXs could improve both in terms of performance and user experience. Basically, MoonDeFi has two main elements: Swap and Staking (Farming). And when users participate in any of the above activities, they will receive a certain profit. What is the MoonDeFi Protocol? MoonDeFi is a protocol on Ethereum for swapping ERC20 tokens. Traditionally, token swaps require buyers and sellers to create liquidity; MoonDeFi creates markets automatically. Unlike most exchanges that charge fees, MoonDeFi was designed with a very low fee structure without any fees. Traders can exchange Ethereum tokens on MoonDeFi without having to trust anyone with their money. Anyone can lend their cryptocurrencies to the liquidity pool and collect a fee. This is done by an equation that automatically determines and balances the value based on actual demand. How MoonDeFi&#x2019;s Protocol Works MoonDeFi is an automatic liquidity marketplace, so, there is no order book or central party required for the transaction, and MoonDeFi allows users to act as a one-stop-shop for any type of exchange, be it a token exchange or a trading platform. To enable trading without an order book, MoonDeFi has developed a model called the liquidity pool, which is created by liquidity providers. Anyone with an Ethereum address can contribute to the liquidity of exchange and make money from it. It allows users to exchange ERC20 tokens, including the native ETH token, without intermediaries. There is one important thing that users should keep in mind: they can seamlessly switch between ERC-20 tokens without the need for an order book. As the MoonDeFi Protocol is decentralized, the listing process is fully decentralized and there is no liquidity pool available for traders. How to Swap Tokens on MoonDeFi MoonDeFi&#x2019;s main distinction from other decentralized exchanges is the use of a pricing mechanism called the &#x201C;Constant Product Market Maker Model.&#x201D; &#x2013; Any token can be added to Moon by funding it with an equivalent value of ETH and the ERC20 token being traded. For example, if a user wanted to make an exchange for an altcoin called Token A, they would launch a new Moon smart contract for Token A and create a liquidity pool with, for example, $10 worth of Token A and $10 worth of ETH. Now, the user is a Liquidity provider. Once a token has its own exchange smart contract and liquidity pool, anyone can trade the token or contribute to the liquidity pool while earning a liquidity provider fee of 0.3%. Ok, that&#x2019;s the way a Liquidity Provider can earn profit from Swap. Staking/Farming on MoonDeFi The innovative Defi platform MoonDeFi has recently made liquidity mining available to users. After the Liquidity Providers contribute their coins to the pool, they will receive LP tokens. Liquidity Providers can use those tokens to participate in the Staking Program with a high profit rate. The reward will be distributed among users who deposit funds to the liquidity pool and join this program. MoonDeFi automatically searches for the latest and most efficient DeFi platforms. It then optimizes productivity with the latest algorithms that can find highly profitable, at the same time very affordable groups for the user. Users then benefit at a steady rate of interest through farming. At MoonDeFi, when users stake a coin/token, they will receive an interest of 30-40% a year, but when users become a liquidity provider and stake their LP tokens, the interest can go up to 45%. MOON, the native token of the MoonDeFi platform itself, is the one with the highest interest rates. So, in summary, MoonDeFi is a more complete version of other DeFi platforms, with the transaction fee earnings of 0.3% of trading fo...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): [['u/max_peterson_17', 'What will happen to bitcoin once people start to barely get rewarded for mining??', 27, '2020-11-29 00:14', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/Bitcoin/comments/k2xxsv/what_will_happen_to_bitcoin_once_people_start_to/', 'The blockchain is supported by miners, but every day we continually reach a point where mining becomes less rewarding.

In his will, he left my twin brother and I  $100,000 each.  \\n\\nMy brother and I were talking about our different investments at the time, and how we were going to invest our new money.  For the last decade or so, I’ve been a silver bug, and I argued that silver was, IMO, the best alternative investment to stocks and bonds.  He had just learned about Bitcoin and was adamant that the return could be exponential.  I had vehemently argued against Bitcoin, saying that it was pure speculation and would be a total waste of money.  \\n\\nWell, he ended up investing about 50k into Bitcoin around then (when Bitcoin was ~$100 each), for over 500 coins.  I, on the other, invested most of it into stocks, and about 30k into silver.  \\n\\nMy brother has never sold any of his Bitcoins.  He’s never even traded them for other crypto currencies.  His job pays him very well very, so he’s never really had liquidity issues.  He has still 500+ coins. \\n\\nMy 30k investment into silver in 2013 is now worth about 26k, and my entire net worth is below 100k.  My brother’s 50k Bitcoin investment, however (which was made within months of the same time as my silver investment), is now worth over $10 million.  His wealth in Bitcoin alone is more than 100 times greater than my entire net worth.\\n\\nHe’s going to retire soon.  He will be selling his house, and live and an investor.  He plans to travel a lot with the wife and kids, and it seems like his life is set.  \\n\\nNow, he did give me one Bitcoin.  And I will not sell it.  As happy as I am for him, though, it really hurts to hear about his fortune and bright future, and not be jealous.  I’ve stopped attending family events (him too), because I can’t get over the overwhelming thought of “hey, you should’ve done what your brother did”, at every waking moment.  It’s extremely depressing.  I try to be thankful for what I do have, and I try to be thankful since I know that many other people in the world have it way worse.  But I don’t know if I’ll ever get over it.

When I tell people that I work in cryptocurrency, people often ask me questions straight out of a horror movie. Isn’t bitcoin creepy? I understand their confusion: Hollywood often acts like everything crypto-related is dark web deals and criminal conduct. In fact, it’s held and traded by millions of law-abiding people around the world and, in the United States, is recognized by the Internal Revenue Service . Catherine Coley is CEO of Binance.US . Related: Why Satoshi Chose Halloween to Release the Bitcoin White Paper Even the nation’s largest bank, JPMorgan Chase , wants to create a digital currency. Electronic or digital currencies hold great potential as non-inflationary global means of trade. Whether you’re an athlete or an artist, a barber or a banker, a teenager or a retiree, cryptocurrency can work for you. Cryptocurrency is exciting, popular and useful but its increased acceptance doesn’t mean that all its shadows have disappeared. Because it’s October, I want to talk about the scariest thing in the crypto world: being tricked by scams. The great 2020 Twitter hack In July, hackers made off with roughly $120,000 in cryptocurrency after hacking major verified Twitter accounts. Accounts belonging to Barack Obama, Bill Gates and others published tweets asking users to send bitcoin to particular wallet addresses. The hacked accounts promised that any shared currency would be doubled and returned. They lied. Given the size, scale and sophistication of the June Twitter hack, it’s a relief to learn that the hackers’ payoff was relatively limited: Millions of people saw the fraudulent tweets, but only 400 deposited funds with the criminals. Any single theft is one theft too many, but the comparatively low number of victims means the crypto community has learned important lessons. And the thieves themselves were schooled in Bitcoin’s technology: The immutable blockchain ledger, which records all transactions in perpetuity, led directly to their arrest. Story continues Related: Money Reimagined: Who Are the Real Monsters? See also: Twitter Hack 2020 – Full Coverage “ Educate, don’t intimidate ” is my motto for business and for life. As my first job was navigating Wall Street’s foreign exchange trading desks, I know how intimidating finance and its terminology can be. The same goes for crypto. From the outside, words like “staking,” “hashing” and “mining” can seem very complicated. But with a little education you, too, can understand it. The last thing I want is to intimidate you and make you believe that there’s a scammer behind every email. But I do want you to recognize the possible signs of criminal activity and protect yourself. Everyone dealing with cryptocurrency should understand the most common grifts and schemes . A closer look at July’s Twitter hack is useful here. The 400 victims who sent funds to hackers imitating Elon Musk or Warren Buffett didn’t know that “giveaways” promising something for nothing are a cybercriminal standby. The July hack was more than “just” a giveaway exploit. If the criminals hadn’t compromised celebrity and politician accounts, their plan wouldn’t have worked. In July, Twitter admitted some of its employees had fallen victim to “spear phishing” attacks – they were convinced, by phone calls and seemingly official emails, to enter sensitive personal data into criminal-controlled websites. You shouldn’t believe everything you see on social media, and you must verify before trusting every email that pops into your inbox or every caller who has your mobile phone number. Take a quick gut check, look at the sender address or Twitter handle. Does it seem too good to be true? Learn from others’ mistakes, but don’t forget that the crooks are vastly outnumbered by honest users. Staying vigilant The digital asset community grows savvier by the day. And much of that comes from learning from mistakes. But, I hope, by reading this you can avoid them. An educated audience makes it harder for scammers to operate, and their return on scamming is shrinking. So, in 2020, are crypto scams on their way out? I wish they were. Just like monsters defeated in one movie only to be revived in sequels, scammers never stay down for long. Earlier this month, I took to Twitter to warn my followers about a fraudulent newsletter making the rounds. We’re still haunted by a few bad actors. Fake cryptocurrency exchange and wallet apps occasionally still show up on mobile app stores. New members of the crypto community sometimes fail to do their own research . And a few networks with bad intentions spend all day on Telegram and Discord lurking for vulnerable targets. With more awareness around crypto and your safety, scams may grow scarcer by the day, but they’re still out there. You may shiver to think of cybercriminals at large and in pursuit of your assets but the more you know the less worried you’re likely to be if you’ve taken the right steps to protect yourself. The perpetrators of the July 2020 Twitter hack were arrested and charged within two weeks. When investigators and law enforcement ripped their masks away, the masterminds were revealed to be teenagers from Florida and Massachusetts. This October, as the jack-o’-lanterns are lit, you may want to indulge in a good shudder over some terrifying scam story or another. It’s true that scams are a problem, but don’t fall for panicked urban legends. You have all the knowledge you need to operate. Smart planning, critical thinking and commonsense precautions can keep you safe from the tricksters and enjoying the treats of digital assets.

This adjustment led some investors to question whether the current formation resembles the $13,850 top formed in July 2019.BTC/USD, July 2019. Source: TradingViewBack then, a 30% drop followed a similar-sized rally, and afterwards it took Bitcoin 14 months to regain the $13,850 level. Coincidently, an intense flash crash happened right after that local high, but the price eventually recovered and stabilized near $12,800.If something similar happened this time around, investors would expect a $13,000 low for the current cycle. Apart from a flash crash following a strong rally, what other indicators mimic the July 2019 price action?The first step is to analyze the futures basis indicator, which can be interpreted as investor optimism. Basis is also frequently referred to as the futures premium, and it measures the premium of longer-term futures contracts to the current spot (traditional markets) levels.Fixed-month futures contracts usually trade at a slight premium, indicating that sellers request more money to withhold settlement longer. On healthy markets, futures should trade at a 5% or more annualized premium, otherwise known as contango.Bitcoin 3-month futures annualized basis, July 2019. Source: SkewSome excessive optimism might have taken place as the basis indicator touched 20% on June 23. Nevertheless, it sustained very healthy levels through the entire price correction back in 2019.The above chart can be interpreted as an absolute unwillingness to reduce long positions. This movement happened despite a $2,000 flash crash followed by a 30% correction from the top. Oddly enough, not even the 30% crash that followed the $13,850 top reduced the futures contract premium. Reduced bullishness usually has a massive impact on the basis indicator.Fast-forward to the current scenario, and there isn't a single instance of excessive optimism according to the same metric.Bitcoin 3-month futures annualized basis, November 2020. Source: SkewThe above chart shows the basis indicator quickly falling below 10% right after the $18,500 top formation. To further differentiate the current price action from July 2019, two weeks ahead of the price peak the futures premium stood at 0%, a clear indication that investors were feeling bearish.This time around, the lowest level over the past couple of weeks has been 7%. This means investors have kept positive expectations over the past couple of months, whereas in July 2019, the market faced an intense, quick, optimistic rush.Options traders weren’t so bullish ahead of the pumpTo better assess the current market sentiment, investors should also evaluate options market spreads. The 25% delta skew indicator will shift to negative when call (neutral/bullish) options are more costly than equivalent put options. The metric usually oscillates between -20% to +20%, and it reflects the current market sentiment.Bitcoin 3-month options 25% delta skew, June 2019. Source: SkewOddly enough, Bitcoin underwent an 80% bull run in the three weeks preceding the $13,850 top, but the options market seemed ill-prepared for this. At the time, protection for the upside using call options were trading at the same premium as the bearish puts.Therefore, we can conclude that option traders were pricing in the same probability of a strong market swing in either direction. This situation has not been the case recently, as the 25% delta skew indicator shows.Bitcoin 3-month options 25% delta skew, November 2020. Source: SkewFor the past 30 days, this option market sentiment gauge has been signaling bullishness. Traders are unwilling to sell protection for the upside, thereby causing the skew indicator to reach an unprecedented -30%. As professional traders are demanding a sizable premium for bullish call options, one can only conclude that a sudden price dump is far away from their expectations.Investors should not make decisions solely based on the interpretation of a single indicator that shows option traders are overly bullish right now. These traders could have been taken by surprise and therefore are not eager to open short positions.There are substantial differences between July 2019 top and the current market according to futures and options markets. This indicates that there are no signs that a 30% drop will occur over the next few days.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.

He procured an award of $115 million in compensatory damages and a further $25 million in punitive damages for his client in 2016 after the defendant posted portions of a sex tape on their website.Harder\\'s prosecution directly led to the downfall of Gawker Media shortly thereafter.

In this instance, Harder was on the winning side of an anti-SLAPP motion.

Ray Dalio Open to Learning About Bitcoin Bridgewater Associates founder Ray Dalio has admitted that he may be wrong about bitcoin after stating last week that he did not think that cryptocurrencies &#8220;will succeed in the way people hope they would.&#8221; He further said that governments will outlaw bitcoin if it becomes material. Dalio is an American billionaire hedge fund manager who founded Bridgewater Associates and has served as its co-chief investment officer since 1985. His hedge fund is the largest in the world, with about $140 billion in assets under management. Dalio has been called the &#8220;Steve Jobs of Investing&#8221; by AICIO Magazine and Wired Magazine. He was also named one of the 100 Most Influential People by TIME Magazine. As the price of bitcoin soared, surging about 55% over the past 30 days, Dalio tweeted on Tuesday: I might be missing something about bitcoin so I’d love to be corrected. &#8220;My problems with bitcoin being an effective currency are simple,&#8221; he began to highlight his concerns in a series of tweets. Firstly, he claimed: &#8220;Bitcoin is not very good as a medium of exchange because you can[not] buy much with it (I presume that’s because it’s too volatile for most merchants to use, but correct me if I’m wrong).&#8221; Secondly, he asserted: &#8220;it’s not very good as a store-hold of wealth because it’s volatility is great and has little correlation with the prices of what I need to buy so owning it doesn’t protect my buying power.&#8221; Next, he reiterated the risk of governments banning bitcoin that he outlined in an interview with Yahoo Finance last week. Dalio said that if bitcoin &#8220;becomes material, governments won&#8217;t allow it.&#8221; He emphasized: &#8220;they&#8217;ll outlaw it and they&#8217;ll use whatever teeth they have to enforce that. They would say &#8230; you can&#8217;t transact the bitcoin, you can&#8217;t have a bitcoin.&#8221; The billionaire fund manager similarly tweeted Tuesday: If it becomes successful enough to compete and be threatening enough to currencies that governments control, the governments will outlaw it and make it too dangerous to use. The Bridgewater Associates founder further argued that &#8220;unlike gold which is the third-highest reserve assets that central banks own, I can’t imagine central banks, big institutional investors, businesses or multinational companies using it.&#8221; Dalio ended his series of tweets with &#8220;If I’m wrong about these things I would love to be corrected. Thank you.&#8221; Bitcoiners Addressing Ray Dalio&#8217;s Concerns Many bitcoiners replied to Dalio&#8217;s bitcoin tweets. While the comments varied, some people attempted to address Dalio&#8217;s three concerns in detail. One of them was Blockfi CEO Zac Prince, who addressed each point Dalio made against bitcoin being an effective currency. Founder of Mythos Capital Ryan Sean Adams chimed in, explaining that &#8220;Bitcoin-like assets aren&#8217;t meant to be a MoE, but a SoV to back digital stablecoins, similar to how gold once backed fiat.&#8221; Addressing Dalio&#8217;s government ban concern, he simply stated that &#8220;Game theory forces central banks to hold it; MMT will forces CBs into the digital realm.&#8221; Capriole Investments founder Charles Edwards noted: &#8220;All new asset classes start from 0. Starting from 0 means there will be volatility to get to a big number. But if you zoom out, put Bitcoin on a log chart, it is almost as close to a straight line up as you can get. Mediums of exchange take time to become accepted among the population.

Traditional investors have long wondered how to value bitcoin. Few have made headway: unlike stocks or commodities, cryptocurrencies have no earnings estimates or growth projections for investors to lean on. So, what drives bitcoin price? The answer may surprise investors because of what’s not included: gold and bitcoin mining supply. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Instead, bitcoin prices are controlled by three critical demand-side factors: Cryptocurrency demand Risk-taking appetite Technical factors Armed with the facts, we’ll examine how these factors will drive prices in 2021. And if you want to learn more about investing in bitcoin, learn more in my Ultimate Guide to Bitcoin . Why Bitcoin? Firstly, why should investors even consider bitcoin? Simple. $10,000 invested in bitcoin in 2015 would have turned to over $430,000 today. And more gains could still come. 7 Hot Food Stocks to Buy for Tasty Returns Bitcoin is now the world’s sixth-largest currency . It’s more widely circulated than the British pound and has a trading velocity six times the U.S. dollar . Bitcoin is also the primary currency of cryptocurrency developers, an essential step to getting venture capital (VC) dollars and attention . BTC Market Share on CoinMarketCap Source: Chart by InvestorPlace, Data courtesy of CoinMarketCap Bitcoin makes up the largest share of all crytocurrencies Now onto valuing bitcoin What Drives Bitcoin Price? Not fundamental valuations… Traditional investors have often tried to develop an “intrinsic value” of bitcoin by analyzing its supply. But that method misses one key fact: bitcoin’s supply remains relatively fixed because of its underlying code. The blockchain caps the maximum number of coins to 21 million. And a self-adjusting difficulty function means cryptocurrency miners have little effect on the speed of mining, unlike in gold or other producible commodities. BTC - Mining Difficulty Aug 2020 Source: Data courtesy of Blockchain Charts Story continues So what drives bitcoin prices in the short-term? Driver 1: Cryptocurrency Demand What assets are bitcoin returns most correlated to? Other cryptocurrencies. Even though the three top cryptocurrencies (bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH) and Ripple (XRP)) run on fundamentally different technologies, correlations between them have jumped since 2017. Today, bitcoin has a 0.9 correlation with both Ethereum and XRP, meaning they move together 90% of the time. BTC - Graph of XRP ETH and Bitcoin Price Correlations Aug 2020 Source: Data courtesy of Yahoo Finance Cryptocurrency correlations have risen over time Essentially, investors have started to view cryptocurrencies as a single asset class . Technology has undoubtedly played a helping hand. Gone are the days of setting up individual wallets for each currency. Coinbase and Robinhood , two major U.S. cryptocurrency platforms, now offer side-by-side comparisons of various coins. Investors can also easily buy index-linked products . Driver 2: Risk-taking appetite What about comparisons to gold? Do investors also see bitcoin as an inflation hedge and a safe-haven asset class? The data says “no.” Bitcoin returns are only 9% correlated with gold, a positive but relatively insignificant amount. Instead, the cryptocurrency has far more in common with risky assets. S&P 500: 22% correlation Junk Bonds: 19% correlation VIX (S&P volatility): -16% correlation (i.e., bitcoin prices decrease in volatile markets) So, contrary to common beliefs, bitcoin doesn’t act as a safe-haven asset. Instead, it does the opposite: its value tends to go up in confident bull markets and fall in fearful bearish ones. BTC - Graph of SNP and Bitcoin Price Returns Aug 2020 Source: Data courtesy of Yahoo Finance Driver 3: Technical Factors Technical analysis requires less efficient markets to work. A study by the U.S. Federal Reserve found that technical analysis in the foreign exchange market worked during the 1970s and ’80s, but declined in the ’90s as information flows improved . Fortunately for cryptocurrency investors, BTC today still resembles the inefficient systems of the 1970s. Bitcoin trades on multiple disconnected exchanges, making it difficult to determine its exact price at any given moment. And investors still routinely accuse market makers of manipulating prices . These factors make trend-following an essential tool in tracking the self-reinforcing prophecies of bitcoin price. That’s meant technical strategies have worked on bitcoin . Below is a graph of RSI-14, a standard mean-reversion indicator. BTC - RSI Buy-Sell Signals Graph of Bitcoin Price Aug 2020 Source: Data courtesy of Yahoo Finance RSI-14 has performed well in tracking BTC buy and sell points An investor using these indicators would have generated 15% higher returns than buy-and-hold while invested just 40% of the time. A more aggressive approach would have pushed returns even higher. How to Invest in Bitcoin for 2021 Bitcoin’s three key drivers mean one thing for 2021: bitcoin prices will depend on the economy. Fast-improving economy. Cryptocurrency demand increases, risk-taking up, technical factors positive. Bitcoin rises to $15,000 – $20,000. Slowing economy. Lower cryptocurrency demand, flight to safety, negative technical factors. Bitcoin falls to RSI resistance levels of $5,800 – $9,000 Which path with bitcoin take? In an August research note, Goldman Sachs’ Global Research team struck an upbeat tone for the 2021 economy. “We now expect that at least one vaccine will be approved by the end of 2020 and will be widely distributed by the end of 2021Q2,” Goldman Sachs economist Joseph Briggs wrote . “We have incorporated this timeline as our baseline forecast, and now assume consumer services spending accelerates in the first half of 2021 as consumers resume activities that would previously have exposed them to Covid-19 risk.” If these expectations play out, bitcoin investors will see good times ahead. But if the economy suddenly grinds to a halt, then bitcoin price will certainly fall. Bitcoin Price Beyond 2021 As trading matures, technical factors will eventually take a backseat in determining bitcoin price. In their place, fundamental factors will start to take over: matters such as transaction fees, forks, user adoption, and the general demand for cryptocurrencies. My colleagues at InvestorPlace have a friendly bet: which will reach 40,000 first: bitcoin or the Dow Jones? And either could be right. But for 2021, how to invest in bitcoin remains clear. As political consultant James Carville once said, “it’s the economy, stupid.” On the date of publication, Tom Yeung did not have (either directly or indirectly) any positions in the securities mentioned in this article.

(Operator Instructions) I would now like to turn the conference over to Adam Minick. Please go ahead. Adam Minick Good morning. I hope you're all doing well today. We will be discussing CME Group's third quarter 2023 financial results. I'll start with the safe harbor language, then I'll turn it over to Terry. Statements made on this call and in the other reference documents on our website that are not historical facts are forward-looking statements. These statements are not guarantees of future performance. They involve risks, uncertainties and assumptions that are difficult to predict. Therefore, actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or implied in any statement. Detailed information about factors that may affect our performance can be found in the filings with the SEC, which are on our website. Lastly, on the final page of the earnings release, you will see a reconciliation between GAAP and non-GAAP measures. With that, I'll turn the call over to Terry. Story continues Terrence A. Duffy Thanks, Adam, and thank you all for joining us this morning. We released our executive commentary earlier today, which provides details on the third quarter of 2023. I'll make a few brief comments on the quarter and current outlook, and Lynne will summarize our financial results. In addition to Lynne, we have other members of our management team present to answer questions after the prepared remarks. Turning to the most recent quarter. Average daily volume of 22.3 million contracts was less than 1% off the record Q3 high set in Q3 2022, while our revenue grew 9% to $1.34 billion, which is the highest Q3 revenue in CME Group's history. As we've mentioned throughout this year, we are operating in an environment that unquestionably requires risk management. With so much uncertainty in the world we live in, we're continuing to work closely with our clients to help them navigate uncertainty and manage their risks. This is particularly true in the interest rate markets today. We see divergent market views around inflation, unemployment, monetary policy and ongoing geopolitical tensions, all impacting future interest rate expectations. Regardless of whether rates rise, fall or hold steady, the shape of the yield curve and interest rate views continue to shift, and our customers need to manage that risk. As a result, we have continued to see growth on top of the record year in 2022 for our interest rate business. This was our highest Q3 for our interest rates complex, up 6% from the same quarter last year. We saw particular strength in the treasury complex, which was up 16% in the quarter and is off to a strong start in Q4 as well. Completing the successful migration of Eurodollars to SOFR, we continue to list other products to complement our interest rate complex today. Our European short-term rate, or ESTR contracts, traded a record 10,000 contracts per day in September. Our newly listed treasury bill futures launched on October 2, and we have traded over 15,000 contracts in the first 3 weeks. This is one of the most successful launches of a [rates] product ever. Our broad product offering and focus on capital efficiencies, such as the enhanced cost-margining agreement with DTCC going live in January of 2024, continue to enhance the value proposition for our customers using our products to manage their interest rate exposure. On the commodity side, third quarter 2023 volume was up 15% in total and included the highest-ever Q3 volume for our agricultural products. Our energy complex also performed well, with volume increasing 16% from last year. We believe the current environment for this asset class will continue to bring new clients as well as existing ones to manage their exposure in our global benchmark. We believe the strong macro environment, combined with our diverse set of asset classes and strategic execution across our growth initiatives, positions us well for continued growth in 2023 and beyond. With that, I'll turn it over to Lynne to cover the third quarter financial results. Lynne Fitzpatrick Thanks, Terry. During the third quarter, CME generated $1.34 billion in revenue, up 9% compared with a strong third quarter of last year. Clearing and transaction fees and market data revenue each grew 9% versus Q3 '22. Expenses continue to be very carefully managed, and on an adjusted basis, were $448 million for the quarter and $369 million excluding license fees, both lower than the second quarter this year. This quarter, our investment in the cloud migration was approximately $13 million. Our adjusted operating margin for the quarter expanded to 66.5%, up approximately 240 basis points compared with the same period last year. CME Group had an adjusted effective tax rate of 22.8%, which resulted in net income of $818 million and adjusted diluted earnings per share of $2.25, each up 14% from the third quarter last year. Of the $110 million increase in revenues versus last year, we were able to drive 90% to the bottom line with adjusted net income up $99 million. As a result of the strong expense discipline throughout the firm, we are lowering our core expense guidance, excluding license fees, to $1.475 billion, a $15 million decrease from our original guidance of $1.49 billion. We are maintaining our guidance of $60 million for our cloud migration expense for a total expense guidance of $1.535 billion excluding license fees. We continue to manage our capital expenditures effectively with an eye towards our move to the cloud. As a result, we are lowering our CapEx guidance [to] $85 million. For the quarter, our capital expenditures were approximately $18 million. CME paid out $2.8 billion of dividends so far this year, and cash at the end of the quarter was approximately $2.5 billion. Our strong financial results this quarter continued to build on the strength achieved in the first half of the year. This quarter, we delivered our ninth consecutive quarter of double-digit adjusted earnings growth. Our global benchmarks, data and strong focus on innovation and execution continue to address the needs of our clients and deliver results for our shareholders. Please refer to the last page of our executive commentary for additional financial highlights and details. We'd now like to open up the call for your questions. (Operator Instructions) Thank you. Question and Answer Session Operator (Operator Instructions) Our first question is from the line of Dan Fannon with Jefferies. Daniel Thomas Fannon Terry, a question for you on M&A. You've been vocal about your financial capacity to do additional transactions. I was hoping you could talk about kind of the scope and what you're looking at. And also, in the context of the current environment, why now? Have valuations come in? Are your competitors distracted with other deals or other tasks? So curious about the current backdrop of what you're looking -- what you're thinking about and really the scope and what that may look like. Terrence A. Duffy Yes. Thanks, Dan. I think that's the reason why people sometimes need to read the whole story and not just the headline. Because if you read the whole story, I haven't said anything different than what I've said for several years, is I was only stating facts to the point where our capacity is much greater than everybody else's because we've stayed very disciplined and very focused as it relates to our M&A transactions that we've done. I was only referring to our EBITDA being lower than 1x compared to some of our competitors who were at multiples of that. When asked the question, if deals are to be offered, I made the reference to the comment that where else would you want to shop something but the CME? It doesn't mean that CME is interested, but that's all I was referencing. So my appetite for this hasn't changed a bit. We have not looked at anything that I -- to a point where I said, \"Okay, we want to do a deal.\" I was only referencing what I've been saying for a number of years. And unfortunately, the headlines say what they're going to say. So there's not much more I can say about it than that, Dan. But again, nothing has changed from ...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: no_data\n- Bitcoin News: no_data\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): no_data\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nVivek Ramaswamy isn't who you'd expect to be a rising star in the Republican Party, but that certainly seems to be the case after the GOP presidential primary debate. The 38-year-old pharmaceutical executive has begun topping current Florida Gov. Ron DeSantis in national polls following a blowout performance in Wednesday's debate. While many polls leave DeSantis in second, it's clear his favor among voters is falling while Ramaswamy's is climbing. In March, DeSantis was consistently polling above 35% among voters. Many recent polls put him under 15%. Ramaswamy announced his run for president near the end of February and was polling between 1% and 5%. Recent polls conducted by Rasmussen Reports and McLaughlin & Associates put Ramaswamy as high as 24%, with some polls putting him with a lead over DeSantis. While these two candidates vie for second place, nearly all polls give former President Donald Trump a substantial lead, polling at over 50%. Trump now has indictments in four states, which has seemingly galvanized his base. The former president's lead has consistently grown since he relaunched his campaign in 2022. Trump's return to X, formerly Twitter, last Friday will likely only help his polling numbers. Don’t Miss: Until 2016 it was illegal for retail investors to invest in high-growth startups.

This New ‘Airbnb For RV's' Platform Takes On The $540 Million RV Rental Market With 25% In Savings And $50,000 For Renters is open for anyone to invest. Ramaswamy Policies And Stocks Set To Benefit A number of Ramaswamy's policies include decreasing government spending and regulation. While these might not have a direct impact on any individual stocks, the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Stock Exchange often benefit generally from policies relating to certain areas of deregulation. Oil, Coal, Nuclear And Natural Gas Like many GOP candidates, Ramaswamy supports energy solutions associated with natural resources like oil, coal, nuclear and natural gas. Because of this, it's likely many stocks in these sectors would benefit largely from a Ramaswarmy presidency. This includes stocks like: ExxonMobil Corp. Chevron Corp. ConocoPhillips Constellation Energy Corp. NuScale Power Corp. Bitcoin And Cryptocurrency While Ramaswamy opposes central bank digital currencies (CBDCs), he has said he is a fan of Bitcoin. Ramaswamy has openly supported Bitcoin, and his campaign page accepts donations in Bitcoin, Doge, Shiba Inu and several other cryptocurrencies. It is unclear whether the candidate will implement policies directly promoting cryptocurrency. Ramaswamy has stated his intentions to strengthen the U.S. dollar over Bitcoin. Story continues Silicon Valley And Startups With an eye toward innovation, Ramaswamy's America First 2.0 agenda and his background in technology and innovation, it's likely many traditional technology stocks would be set for a rally. Stocks like Alphabet Inc. and Apple Inc. perform well regardless of which party is in the White House. But tax incentives relating to moving operations to America could help benefit their bottom line in the long run. Promoting innovation and small businesses in the U.S. will likely have a positive effect. The venture capital market has seen declines of over 50% in the U.S. for the first six months of 2023. Retail startup investing platforms like StartEngine and Wefunder have seen declines at slower rates but are beginning to rebound. Many of these sectors could move in a positive direction because of deregulation and policies promoting small businesses, innovation and working trades.

In 2018 alone, the STA opened investigations into the activities of up to 400 Swedish crypto traders – 10 times more than the previous year. STA control coordinator Henrik Kisterudsaysthat last year’s results, which brought to light a number of “unrecognized activities,” would result in more resources being allocated to crypto investigations this year.\nAccording to Dunkers, the STA’s tax demands are “unreasonable” because he is being charged 300 percent of his total profits. Between 2014 and 2016, he traded bitcoin worth SEK 25 million (~$2.75) million and made a moderate profit. Now, the tax agency is taxing Dunkers’ profits at the enhanced rate because he did not deduct the price of his initial bitcoin purchase, which was paid in cash. The STA says that, by law, this makes his tax burden higher.\nHe also claims that in 2014, Swedish tax laws were not clear on where exactly crypto trading fell under, and he thought they would be classified as a “hobby activity.” It wasn’t until 2016, he says, that the tax agency reached out, instructing him to file his crypto trades under the category of capital income.\nFollowing this notification, he included his crypto trades on the tax forms, but since he was still unaware of how exactly to declare the trades, he included a side note agreeing to corrections if his reports were wrong. He claims he got no response until ...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[22467, 'london-stock-exchange-trading-tech-to-power-new-hong-kong-crypto-exchange', 5313, 'London Stock Exchange Trading Tech to Power New Hong Kong Crypto Exchange', '2019-01-22 19:38:00', 'The technology solutions provider for the London Stock Exchange Group has announced that its matching engine will be used to power a new Hong Kong crypto exchange.', 'LSEG Technology, the technology solutions provider for the London Stock Exchange Group, has announced that its matching engine will be used to power a new Hong Kong-based digital assets exchange.

Speaking of the deal, ATOM Group CEO Peter Lin said the technology would help deliver “greater levels of fairness, transparency, and performance” for crypto traders.The licensing deal between a stalwart mainstream market solutions provider and an emergent disruptive platform apparently aims to mitigate concerns over security, market manipulation, and high-volume performance in the crypto industry.In the Hong Kong context, there have been recent indications from the local securities regulator, the Securities and Futures Commission (SFC), that a legal framework to regulate crypto exchanges is under consideration, with the SFC chairman stating last October:“We need to see if and how these [digital assets trading] platforms can be regulated to a standard that is comparable to that of a licensed trading venue, while at the same time ensuring investors[‘] interest[s] are being protected.”In November, the SFC released details of its evolving proposed conduct regulation for crypto exchanges, alongside guidelines for funds dealing with cryptocurrency. As Hong Kong’s formal crypto regulatory environment continues to take shape, some local lawyers have warned that new regulations may prove cumbersome or even harmful for new entrants to the crypto industry.\\n'], [22463, 'nyse-operators-long-awaited-crypto-platform-bakkt-announces-new-key-vacancies', 14337, 'NYSE Operator’s Long-Awaited Crypto Platform Bakkt Announces New Key Vacancies', '2019-01-22 17:40:00', 'Bakkt, the cryptocurrency platform owned by the Intercontinental Exchange, announced that they are hiring.', 'Bakkt, the cryptocurrency platform created by the operator of the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE), announced that they are hiring for a number of high-up positions in a tweet Jan. 22.The Intercontinental Exchange’s (ICE) much-awaited crypto platform published a list of eight evidently new vacancies at the company, all of which are based in Atlanta and New York City. Some of the positions also have Hong Kong, Tokyo, San Francisco, London, Tel Aviv and Singapore listed as available locations.The page specifies that the company is mostly trying to hire a number of developers, mostly at director and senior levels.In particular, Bakkt is looking to hire a director of blockchain engineering, a blockchain developer, a director of security engineering, a senior full stack engineer, a mobile developer and a software development engineer in test. Also, the company is looking for a director of finance and at least one institutional sales member.As Cointelegraph reported on the last day of December 2018, the ICE announced that it “expects to provide an updated launch timeline in early 2019 for the trading, clearing and warehousing” of its Bakkt Bitcoin (USD) Daily Futures Contracts.On the same day, news broke that the platform had completed its first funding round, raising $182.5 million from 12 partners and investors.In November, ex-Goldman Sachs partner and founder of crypto investment firm Galaxy Digital, Mike Novogratz, cited Bakkt’s pending launch as a possible catalyst for the crypto market’s next major price action.\\n'], [22462, 'who-scales-it-best-inside-blockchains-ongoing-transactions-per-second-race', 38850, 'Who Scales It Best? Inside Blockchains’ Ongoing Transactions-Per-Second Race', '2019-01-22 17:28:00', 'QtumX protocol can reportedly handle more than 10,000 transaction per second. What about others?', \"\\nOpen-source project Qtum representatives claim that their enterprise blockchain dubbed ‘QtumX’ can accommodate “more than 10,000” transactions per second (TPS), according to a press release recently shared with Cointelegraph.\\nWith yet another player being added to the scalability race, it makes sense to look back and see how the main blockchains and cryptocurrencies stand in regard to TPS — and whether their numbers are actually authentic.\\nTransaction speed: How important is it?\\nScalability is one of cryptocurrencies’ main issues, especially when it comes to the older coins. In fact, one of the first public comments on Bitcoin’s (BTC) white paper opened with the following line: “We very, very much need such a system, but the way I understand your proposal, it does not seem to scale to the required size.”\\nTen years on, the problem still persists — the original blockchain can reportedly process only around seven TPS, which eventually led to dire consequences. At the end of 2017, Bitcoin users had to pay around $28 in fees so their transactions wouldn’t take days to complete. Those problems resulted in a hard fork and a new Bitcoin-based currency, Bitcoin Cash (BCH), which moved on to increase the maximum block size up to eight megabytes from just one.\\nMany other, newer cryptocurrencies have since attempted to create their own blockchains, which are allegedly faster and cheaper. Their primary goal was often to beat the ultimate crypto nemesis, the centralized global payment system Visa, which can process 24,000 TPS, according to the IBM study conducted back in 2010. Many blockchains have since surpassed that point during their scalability race, but only on paper.\\nIt is important to recognize that while TPS, confirmation time and scalability in general might be important for the long-awaited mass adoption to come, they are not the only criteria. Many cryptocurrencies claim to have high TPS performance these days, but the transaction speed is often dependable and is generally hard to measure — especially with real-time traffic instead of test networks, with their ideal conditions in terms of latency. As a result, many of the claimed TPS are different from their actual value.\\nBesides, even with a high TPS, the demand might not be there. This has been clearly visualized on the Txstreet website, where every transaction is pictured as a person, and they fill up buses that represent the block space of BTC and BCH. BCH has more buses — as its block size is bigger — but few passengers to fill them. On contrary, while there are just two buses for BTC, they fill quickly, and a lot of people are left crowded on the pavement, waiting to hop on the next block. Even the above mentioned Visa, which has the capacity to run at 24,000 TPS, reportedly does only 2,000 TPS on average, and up to 4,000 during peak hours — in other words, it doesn’t need more at this point.\\n\\nQtum\\nClaimed TPS capacity: 10,000\\nQtum developers recently ran the blockchain’s benchmark on Amazon EC2 virtual server and, according to its own estimations, QtumX “is able to handle more than 10,000 TPS.” They stress that, due to the high speed, transactions are supposedly confirmed as soon as they are sent to the network.\\nIt is important to note that QtumX has not been audited by third parties, and it is therefore impossible to confirm the authenticity of Qtum’s press release at this point. Similar to QtumX is Aelf, another business-oriented blockchain solution, whose development team reported achieving as many as 15,000 TPS during the initial test run in August 2018.\\nRipple\\nClaimed TPS capacity: 50,000 (estimated: 1,500)\\nAccording to Ripple, XRP, the digital asset used in the company’s cross-border payment system, “consistently handles 1,500 transactions per second.” Moreover, it allegedly takes just around four seconds for payments to settle, while XRP can scale up to 50,000 TPS “to handle the same throughput as Visa.”\\nHowever, unlike most other currencies mentioned in this article, Ripple doesn’t have a blockchain. For that purpose, the company has its own patented technology: the Ripple protocol consensus algorithm. Consequently, XRP has been disregarded as a cryptocurrency by part of the community.\\nEthereum\\nEstimated TPS capacity: 15\\nEthereum (ETH) scales poorly even despite a large amount of miners: Currently, its blockchain accommodates around 20 TPS. However, the situation is likely to change once ETH moves from the proof-of-work (PoW) to the proof-of-stake (PoS) algorithm.\\nThat will reportedly be implemented in the new protocol called Casper — Friendly Finality Gadget, which will also employ sharding on top of PoS. Cointelegraph has covered the protocol in greater detail in a separate article.\\nHowever, Ethereum developers have been failing to run upgrades on time. Most recently, they rescheduled the Constantinople hard fork to late February after finding a vulnerability hours prior to the original time of release. Therefore, it is unclear when exactly Casper will be introduced. However, it might arrive as soon as this year, according to its developers.\\nEOS\\nClaimed TPS capacity: 3,996 (estimated: 50)\\nIn July 2018, EOS’s chief technology officer, Daniel Larimer, tweeted that its cryptocurrency was performing at 2,351 TPS.

Connolly hopes the new show will help the public better understand the innovative cryptocurrency ecosystem. Also Read: Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform Bitquick Implements Bitcoin Cash Support Entourage Actor and Blockchain Advocates Begin Pre Production of Cryptos Digital currency fans will be intrigued to hear about a new television show called Cryptos, a series that’s currently being directed by the Hollywood actor Kevin Connolly. The story follows a young startup trying to launch a cryptocurrency-fueled entertainment platform. The series will also feature Kevin Connolly, who is known for his role as Eric E Murphy in Entourage. Connolly has also agreed to direct the cryptocurrency-focused show&#8217;s episodes. The cofounders of the Academy School of Blockchain, Jason King and Erik Sords, are also co-producing the series. King is well known for helping start the Florida-based homeless shelter Sean’s Outpost in Pensacola, an initiative that’s been powered by cryptocurrency donations. News.Bitcoin.com spoke with King about the show and he explained how he got involved. “The series is being produced by American Cinema International and we’re currently in pre-production at the moment,” King told news.Bitcoin.com. “I came on board about six months ago after reading the pilot and I helped develop the story architecture for the first season — We hope to start filming in May.” Kevin Connolly is an actor and director known for the HBO series Entourage (2004), Entourage (2015), and the movie The Notebook (2004). Producers Hope to Bring Cryptocurrencies to the Mainstream While Providing a Robust Storyline of Relationships and Friendships Meanwhile, in real life Erik Sords is in the midst of developing a “decentralized global studio” called Dionysia in L.A. The “Cryptos” show reflects how hard it is to finance movies, forcing the group of friends to fund a project using digital currencies in order to create a peer-to-peer film studio, much like the Dionysia concept. In a recent interview, the show’s actor and director Connolly thinks people are scared to conceptualize cryptocurrencies because of “a lack of understanding.” “People like myself are still learning, but the curiosity is there,” Connolly added. The Entourage series actor continued: [Sords and King] want to bring cryptocurrencies to the mainstream for the better of cryptocurrency and I’m just the filmmaker interested in telling cool stories and exploring cool characters — For me, it’s about relationships and friendships — That’s what people tune in to see. Connolly also emphasized that what he liked most about the written pilot was that it involved a motley crew of down and out actors that say &#8220;screw the establishment&#8221; and try to take on the entire Hollywood system. The TNABC event was the first time the crew had revealed the television show to the public and the audience welcomed the idea with applause when Connolly announced the show launch. The film’s creators are aiming to produce a total of 10 episodes for the first season. Furthermore, the producers are hoping the show will be picked up by major streaming platforms like Amazon Prime and Netflix. What do you think about the Cryptos television show concept?

Despite being on course to become the longest downtrend in BTC&#x2019;s annals, the current market has produced the weakest drawdown of the three major bear trends experienced by BTC so far. Also Read:&#xA0;How to Buy Bitcoin Anonymously Cryptocurrency Markets Within One Month of Comprising Longest Downtrend Ever On Jan. 16, 2019, CNBC&#x2019;s Ran Neuner tweeted that the 2018/2019 bear trend had entered its 390th day &#x2013; just 30 fewer days than the entirety of the 2014/2015 bear trend, which he estimates lasted 420 days. While the exact length of a bear trend is hard to precisely quantify, the tweet highlights the length and intensity of the prevailing cryptocurrency downtrend. When counting from BTC&#x2019;s all-time high of approximately $19,700 on Dec. 17, 2017, it has been 401 days since the start of the current downtrend. As of the recent low of roughly $3,100, the current bear market has resulted in a drawdown of up to to 84 percent on the price of BTC. 2014 Bear Market Comprises Longest and Bloodiest to Date When counting from record highs preceding 2017 until the low of the following trend, the 2014/2015 bear market appears to have lasted 410 days. On Nov. 30, 2013, prices peaked at a record high of roughly $1,180, precipitated by a lengthy downtrend that finally capitulated on Jan. 14, 2015 when prices crashed to post a local low of $155 &#x2013; a drawdown of 87 percent. The first significant bear trend in BTC&#x2019;s history lasted from 162 days from Jun. 9, 2011 until Nov. 18, 2011. After starting the year trading for just $0.30, BTC rallied to post a then-record high of $29.58 during early June. The markets would then lose nearly 93 percent over the course of little more than five months, with the bear trend easing after hitting $2.14 on Nov. 18, 2011.

Karpeles explained how he’s been accused of financial misconduct in a land that has a 99 percent conviction rate and he wouldn&#8217;t wish his experience on anyone. Also Read: Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform Bitquick Implements Bitcoin Cash Support Mark Karpeles Speaks of Japan&#8217;s &#8220;Hostage Justice&#8221; in Latest Interview This week, Mark Karpeles spoke in an interview about his experience in a Japanese jail after being charged by the Tokyo court system for embezzlement tethered to the Mt Gox operations. When Karpeles was the chief executive of the Tokyo exchange Mt Gox, the trading platform lost approximately 850,000 bitcoins that belonged to customers. At the time, the loss represented nearly 6 percent of the bitcoins in circulation. Roughly 200,000 coins were eventually “found” and Karpeles and the company filed for bankruptcy on Feb. 28, 2014. Mark Karpeles tells CNN he is a victim of Japan&#8217;s &#8220;hostage justice&#8221; system. A year later, Karpeles was arrested for allegedly changing important data within the Mt Gox computer system and was later arrested again and charged with embezzling $3 million from the company. Karpeles has maintained his innocence the entire time, but did time in jail and was released on bail as long as he doesn&#8217;t leave the country. Speaking in his recent interview, the former exchange operator gives his account of some of the injustice he allegedly faced during his jail time and interrogation. Karpeles says he wouldn&#8217;t wish the experience on his worst enemy and even “humanity’s worst enemy.” Karpeles must not leave Japan and he faces a verdict this March. “There’s a very big feeling of powerlessness — Whatever you do, there’s nothing you can do,” says Karpeles during his CNN interview. Karpeles took detailed notes of his 12 months in Japanese jail and explained that Japanese police interrogated him for 50 days straight, up to 8 hours a day without his lawyer. Soon Karpeles expects to hear a verdict on his charges in a country where the conviction rate is 99 percent. Karpeles adds: The more you try and deny being guilty the harsher it gets. Karpeles says he has comprehensive notes on how he was treated in a Japanese prison. The notebook in the photo allegedly is his notes on the entire jail experience and interrogation. Bitcoiners Weigh in on the Japanese Conviction Rate The Karpeles interview on CNN appeals to people who believe the Japanese conviction rate is draconian and the broadcast also discusses the former Nissan chairman Carlos Ghosn. Like Karpeles, the Nissan executive is being charged with the same crimes, including a charge called “breach of trust.” Further, Ghosn’s interrogation is also being scrutinized and he has already been rejected one bail request due to being a &#8220;flight risk.&#8221; Japanese prosecutors say the justice system is fair. “We would...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): Total MarketCap $120 Billion\nBitcoin Dominance: 52.37%\n24h Vol: $15,934,492,037\nActive Currencies: 2116 pic.twitter.com/7ltd9UNBlB || Korean Crypto Exchange Executives Fake Trading Volumes, Earn Prison Sentences\n\nlink: https://www.ccn.com/korean-crypto-exchange-executives-fake-trading-volumes-earn-prison-sentences/ …\n#bitcoin $BTC #BTC #ETH $ETH #CRYPTO #news #USD #TRUMP #GBP #blockchain #ico #techpic.twitter.com/g9RtGflNnO || 2019 One More Bitcoin Crash! - Crypto technical analysis #TradingViewhttps://forexandcryptocurrencynews.com/2019/01/20/2019-one-more-bitcoin-crash-crypto-technical-analysis-tradingview/ … || 現在の1ビットコインあたりの値段は394,152.4510円です。値段の取得日時はJan 22, 2019 15:59:00 UTCです #bitcoin #ビットコイン || this channel called $DGB before it made 6x. they only share high reward, low risk signals. join:\n\nhttp://t.me/CryptoHeatsignals …\n$BTC $ETH $ETC $BCH $LTC $XRP $DASH $BTG $XLM $XMR $ZEC $ADA $SNT $NEO $NXT $OMG $POWR $VTC $LUX $XEM $LSK $DGB $DOGE $XVG $GRS $AMP $ZCL $DRGN $DCR 74883 || 自分は貧ちゃんなので、最小金額で1回しかマイニングしてないんで本当に微々たる配当しかないんですが、BTC、ETH、リップル、などなどからモナコインまでいろんなコインが配当されるので、本当にたのしいですよ(*≧∀≦)ゞ || 2015 Lambo Huracan costs $175k or 47.98  BTC today. https://lambobtc.com  #BTC $BTC #BITCOIN $BITCOIN #LAMBO $LAMBO #CRYPTO $CRYPTO || Top 6 BTC/USD Exchange Orderbooks: Resistance til $3900:$24.7M; Support til $3300:$28.5M #kraken #gdax #bitstamp #bitfinex #poloniex #gemini || #ANON #APIS #APOT #APR Coin #APX #ARbit #ATC Coin #ATLANT #ATN #AVINOC #AWARE #Absolute #Aces #AdCoin #AdEx #AdHive #AdShares #Adelphoi\n#crypto #Bitcoin #ICO #trading #tradingbotpic.twitter.com/kqfZfJzDm4 || don't miss out on registering on Binance, before they close registrations again\n\n https://www.binance.com/?ref=22686820 \n$BTC $ZCL $ETH $ETC $BCH $LTC $XRP $DASH $BTG $XLM $XMR $ZEC $SNT $ADA $NEO $NXT $OMG $POWR $VTC $VOX $XEM $LSK $DGB $DOGE $COVAL $XVG $GRS $AMP $strat $sc $XRB $NAV  56194pic.twitter.com/RzMVksjXcG || Intertops Casino 50 Free Spins for New Players & $500 New Slot Bonus with Free Spins https://www.noluckneeded.com/intertops-casino-500-bonus-and-20-50-free-spins-wu-zetian-t22212.html … Trusted #Bitcoin #Crypto #BitcoinCash #Litecoin Casino est 1998pic.twitter.com/AyRqqPDGp7 || South Korean Exchange Loses $5 Million in Accidental Bitcoin Airdrop https://www.coindesk.com/south-korean-exchange-loses-5-million-in-accidental-bitcoin-airdrop … via @CoinDesk || El precio promedio de bitcoin en las casas de cambio es $3597.89 (USD). || @ProBit_Exchange lists #Digibyte with DGB/BTC pair, and is therefore also added to their Digital Cash Event. https://www.probit.com https://twitter.com/ProBit_Exchange/status/1087506800130297862 … || Top 100 avg 24h return: 0.9±6.9%; 63 up, 36 down\n$BTC 0.7%  $ETH 0.9%\nBest:\n42.5% $LRC @loopringorg\n15.8% $FCT @factom\n14.9% $LINK @smart_contract\n13.8% $RVN @ravencoin\n13.6% $XIN @MixinMessenger\nWorst:\n-9.5% $REP\n-12.1% $PAY\n-18.2% $DCN\n-21.9% $AOA\n-23.5% $APL\n#cryptotradingpic.twitter.com/qPxntw4hHl || Top 100 avg 1h return: 0.0±1.6%; 63 up, 35 down\n$BTC 0.2%  $ETH 0.2%\nBest:\n4.1% $PAY @tenxwallet\n4.0% $RVN @ravencoin\n3.7% $LINK @smart_contract\nTop 101-200 avg 1h return: 0.6±2.1%; 70 up, 29 down\nBest:\n18.6% $TEL @telcoin_team\n6.9% $PMA @PumaPay\n5.0% $LML @gny_io\n#altcoinspic.twitter.com/dDmgHvOZvs || Please Don’t Hurt Us!

Declining from ~$20,000 to ~$4,000 at the time of this writing leaves speculators wondering if 2019 is a year for the bulls. With Bitcoin being a new, relatively low volume asset class gaining steam, fundamentals play a seemingly exaggerated role with price action, and technical analysis is gradually becoming more reliable.\nGenerally, capitulation refers to a time when holders are indefinitely committed to holding and panic sellers have cut their losses, forming a true bottom in the market. Using technical analysis, we want to find the support for this bear run.\nTo find true support, it is important to understand the long-term movement from $1,000 to $20,000. The year 2017 showed this meteoric price increase and prior to this bull run, the price was gradually increasing from $700-$1,000. As seen in the chart below, the entire year of 2017 was a continual, irrational bull run filled with hype and over-valued ICOs, with substantial, original support at $1,000. The volume during 2017 was unprecedented, which means that lots of buyers and new investors were buying in all the way up to $20,000 per Bitcoin. Once Bitcoin broke ~$2,000 there was virtually no resistance – and it showed.\nNow, let’s look at the other side of the mountain, 2018.\nThroughout the entire year of 2018, the market has yet to find its support. Each day news outlets and influencers have been calling bottoms, but with no avail.\nZooming in closer to at three-month view shows signs that a bottom is finally approaching.\nHere we can get a bit more technical. As of November 14th, the price dropped from ~$5,800 to ~$3,800 within 10 days. This is a near 35% dip after experiencing a year-long ~80% price decline for the asset. After hitting a low of $3,288 it bounced back to $4,384 with significant volume. This strong bounce back of over $1,000, coupled with noticeably high volume, is a reliable indicator that sellers have sold, and buyers are ready to buy.  At this time of this writing, Bitcoin is trading at $3,844. Ultimately, if the price breaks below $3,288 again, then there is no reason that we will not see the $1,000 support which was held before the bull run, by core believers.\nOn the other hand, if this new price point introduces new buyers to the market, then we will most likely stay sideways for at least 6 months. The reasoning behind this is that it should be assumed that there are many holders still holding big losses, waiting to sell along the way up, anywhere from current price back up to $20,000. Only at the point which the price breaks $20,000 can we say there is no resistance, until then, it may be a long road back to the top with resistance at each price point along the way.\nWhile technical analysis plays an important role in predicting Bitcoin’s price, the volatility is so extreme that there is arguably just as much, or more merit to understanding the fundamentals. With some legal clarity, things can turn around quick.\nTo reiterate, looking at the chart for the years of 2017 and 2018 show a seemingly irrational price increase and decrease. To confirm your beliefs, it was irrational, the price increase was mostly based on lots of hype and investors treating Bitcoin like a lottery ticket. ICOs were raising billions of dollars, and investors were putting no thought into their investments.\nLet’s understand a couple of causes for the price decline, so then we can understand what will cause a price increase. Amongst several factors at play, I can narrow it down to two main reasons for the price decline: ICOs and regulation.\nICOs are initial coin offerings where project issue tokens in exchange for Bitcoin or Ethereum, primarily. Whether ICOs were ill-intentioned or not, many proved to be unsuccessful in finishing their product. As a result, many projects are selling the funds raised back to fiat. In doing this, the fiat value of Bitcoin will decline. It is assumed that even ICOs which raised Ether during their crowdsale could easily have sold Ethereum to Bitcoin, then back to USD for greater liquidity and less impact on price. With billions of dollars sent to unsuccessful projects, many of them are liquidating and moving on with their lives.\nNow, the positive effect of this is that crypto investors are more mature and cautious with their investments. ICOs are still happening and they are an excellent way to raise funds. The industry is now focused more on actual adoption, practical usability, and experienced teams. Ultimately, this should bring about a more consistent industry, with more reliable charts and less volatility. The massive hype in the market is gradually becoming a thing of the past.\nThis was another major disappointment for 2018. Investors and speculators have been hoping for ETFs, tax reforms, and more legal clarity around Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies in general. Due to the instability of Bitcoin’s price ETF proposals have been denied by the SEC. Without an ETF, a majority of equity-based hedge funds and institutional investment firms cannot invest in Bitcoin, despite their clients asking them to include it in their portfolios. These funds are regulated by the SEC, and unless they are an FX or commodity fund, they legally cannot advise or purchase Bitcoin directly. Instead, they must rely on another investment vehicle, such as an ETF, which is a security, to speculate on the Bitcoin market.\nThe second is taxes and legal clarity. There are significant flaws in how Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies are taxed. Simply put, each trade is a realized gain or loss, whether or not an investor has sold back to USD. This means that if you purchase Ethereum using Bitcoin, then this is a taxable event, owed in USD to the IRS. An investor would then need to sell some of their cryptos to USD, which is another taxable event, simply to pay taxes. These conversions significantly hurt profits for traders.\nAdditionally, if an ETF is approved in 2019, and taxes favor the trader more, then it is likely that 2019 will have a bull run beyond $20,000 with major institutional money flowing in from banks, hedge funds, asset managers, prime brokerages and high net worth individuals. If this does not happen, then our best bet for a bull run is to rely on the startups building practical, needed products for businesses and retail customers. Until then, it is likely that we will stay sideways with a less volatile year for Bitcoin.\nThisarticlewas originally posted on FX Empire\n• Olymp Trade ceases registration for new clients in Russia\n• RoboForex Introduces New Bonus and Raises Leverage Up to 1:2000\n• EUR/USD Price Forecast – EUR/USD Trades Zig-Zag Amid Holiday Thin Market on Dollar’s Recovery\n• GBP/USD Should Proceed Down If the Price Gets Below Weekly Pivot Point\n• Price of Gold Fundamental Daily Forecast – Renewed Stock Market Weakness Could Drive Prices to $1284.10\n• Sinopec Scandal Drags On Chinese Equities, EU Markets Play Catch-Up, No Follow-Through For US Market\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":42,\"stop_loss\":3428.94,\"take_profit\":3723.12,\"forecast_10d\":[3585.12, 3600.87, 3599.77, 3602.46, 3583.97, 3470.45, 3448.12, 3486.18, 3457.79, 3487.95]}"}

Partially reversing a 4.01% slide from Thursday, Bitcoin ended the day at $48,830.0. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin slide to an early morning intraday low $46,417.0 before making a move. Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $46,735 before striking a late intraday high $49,489.0.

For example, at the start of the year, Bitkub, the country’s largest cryptocurrency exchange, was shut down by regulators after the trading platform faced a series of lengthy service outages.\\xa0Despite these seemingly stringent conditions, the country’s crypto market has continued to thrive. That being said, a tipping point came recently when Thailand’s Securities and Exchange Commission released a statement that it plans to enact a 1-million-baht (about $33,000) annual income\\xa0minimum requirement for crypto investment in the country.The decision was met with immediate backlash from the local investor community — as it would potentially exclude low- and middle-income earners from the cryptocurrency market — so much so that the regulatory body had to clarify its above-stated stance within days of making the announcement.In this regard, the SEC noted that the previous draft document was just a means of gauging investor sentiment, with Ruenvadee Suwanmongkol, secretary-general of the Thai SEC, claiming: “I proposed the criteria that many considered too tough to prompt people to express their opinions on the matter and did not intend to say these are the exact qualifications that will be implemented.”Providing his thoughts on the matter, Pinpraaj Chakkaphak, CEO of local cryptocurrency exchange ERX, told Cointelegraph that the original intention of the SEC was not malicious but one that sought to create a mechanism that could help protect investors from any unwarranted market risks, adding:“We understand the good intentions of the SEC. However, many stakeholders in the digital assets market and the majority of the public disagree with the plan. From ERX’s point of view, this protection mechanism should not focus on minimum income; instead, it should come in the form of improved information disclosure by operators and investor education.”Regulations should not impede market growthTo gain a better overview of the situation, Cointelegraph spoke with Konstantin Anissimov, executive director at CEX.IO — one of the most widely used crypto exchanges in Thailand. In his opinion, by taking a stance that potentially hampers lower-income families from gaining access to a potentially lucrative investment class, the SEC was going against the very fundamentals of a free-market economy and freedom of choice. However, on the other hand, he did concede that if a majority of the lower-income population did not have any basic financial education and understanding of the risks of such investments, the SEC’s approach may have been the only way to protect the public’s best interests. Anissimov added:“Multiple approaches can be taken, and minimum income is just one of them. I am sure that the Thai SEC will take on the feedback received from the investment community and act in the interest of its population.”Additionally, in a statement shared with Cointelegraph, Akalarp Yimwilai, CEO of a local crypto trading platform Zipmex, pointed out that he sincerely believes that the proposed draft law comes from a place of good intent and that it serves to protect investors by minimizing unnecessary risks. He highlighted that the Thai crypto market is still in its infancy and that regulations around the space have only come into being around three years ago. As a result, the SEC is still looking to craft a legal framework for this asset class that can protect investors from future risks. However, Yimwilai did go on to say:“The proposed draft aims to protect, but it is important to also see that in doing so, a higher wall is being proposed which limits the opportunity of access to digital assets for many in this country. The key here, I believe, is to work hand in hand with the SEC to ensure the sustainability and height of that wall.”Lastly, he believes that if the current draft was to get implemented, it could potentially lead to a substantial rise in the number of scams, potentially driving investors into an unregulated market where they could run into uncharted territory. Not only that, it could also lead to a lot of much-needed capital flowing out of Thailand, resulting in the long-term detriment to the country’s development and finances.The Thai crypto market has been boomingThe Thai digital assets industry has\\xa0grown\\xa0significantly during recent months. According to the country’s SEC, the number of cryptocurrency trading accounts within the county has risen from 160,000 at the end of 2020 to 470,000 on Feb. 1. Not only that, approximately 50% of these accounts are owned by investors younger than 30 years of age.Furthermore, Chakkaphak pointed out that crypto trading volumes in November 2020 lay at 18.44 Billion THB, compared to 100.90 billion in February 2021, thus showcasing a staggering increase of 447.18% within a matter of just three months. He went on to add:“Investors wanting to invest in the traditional stock market or in digital assets should educate themselves and do in-depth research. Our priority is to enable and educate investors to learn and build knowledge about investing in digital assets, as it is a new opportunity for all investors.”Also, according to Yimwilai, Zipmex traded $1 billion in 2020 in Thailand, with the figure expected to grow exponentially in 2021. Not only that, but the cryptocurrency exchange was also able to\\xa0raise\\xa0$6 million in fresh funding from U.S.-based VC firm Jump Capital. He further highlighted that the assets under the company’s management are currently valued at around $100 million, which seems to back up the notion that the Thai masses are ready to dive head first into the burgeoning crypto sector.Do things look promising?Though for now, the SEC seems to be backtracking on its initial outline for market entry requirements.\\xa0According to the Suwanmongkol, people who are putting their hard-earned money into cryptocurrencies are mostly new investors who may not be fully aware of the risks that come with investing in h...\n- Bitcoin News: [[446216, '2021-03-06 22:45:05', \"Ripple's Asia Pacific Business Flourishing Despite SEC Lawsuit, Says CEO\", 'ripples-asia-pacific-business-flourishing-despite-sec-lawsuit-says-ceo', 'Jeffrey Gogo', 'Ripple chief executive officer Brad Garlinghouse said Friday that the company&#x2019;s business in the Asia-Pacific region has not suffered from the ongoing regulatory issues in the U.S. Ripple&#x2019;s Business in Asia and Japan Sees Growth Ripple is facing a $1.3 billion lawsuit from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC).

She has provided some advice on how to invest in the cryptocurrency a month, noting that she prefers to buy bitcoin through Paypal&#x2019;s crypto service because the payments giant has made it easy to do so. Suze Orman Loves Bitcoin Suze Orman said she loves bitcoin in an interview with Yahoo Finance published Friday where she shared her bitcoin investing strategy and advised listeners how they should start investing in the cryptocurrency. She founded the Suze Orman Financial Group in 1987 and her Suze Orman Show ran on CNBC from 2002 to 2015.

She elaborated, &#x201C;I like that it&#x2019;s just there and the corporations that are investing in it.&#x201D; However, the two-time Emmy-Award-winning television host added: &#x201C;I do not like bitcoin as a currency. I don&#x2019;t like it where you&#x2019;re going to buy a Tesla or you are going to buy something with it. I like it as a possible replacement for gold, as an investment.&#x201D; Recently, Elon Musk&#x2019;s electric car company, Telsa, said that it will soon start accepting BTC as a means of payment for its products. Orman further revealed: &#x201C;I personally played bitcoin through Microstrategy. In June of last year, I bought Microstrategy at about $125 a share, right around there.&#x201D; She explained that &#x201C;There was something about the CEO,&#x201D; Michael Saylor, who made her think, &#x201C;this man is making sense to me.&#x201D; Microstrategy has been buying bitcoin since August last year. As of March 5, the company is hodling about 91,064 bitcoins. &#x201C;I rode it [Microstrategy] all the way up and I sold. I think it was last week at right about $1,000 a share because I didn&#x2019;t like, for the first time, bitcoin was going up but Microstrategy was going down,&#x201D; Orman said.

She cautioned about the risks associated with investing in bitcoin. &#x201C;What I tell my listeners and what I would tell everybody, bitcoin is seriously risky,&#x201D; she began. &#x201C;I would not be investing in bitcoin with money that I cannot afford to lose because the swings are not just going to be a point or two a day. They&#x2019;re going to be $5,000 worth one day. It&#x2019;s going to be up 7%, down 10%, it&#x2019;s going to be all over the place.&#x201D; Nonetheless, she advised, &#x201C;But I think that it&#x2019;s something that wouldn&#x2019;t hurt people if they had it to lose, $100 a month in it.&#x201D; The personal finance guru further opined: I personally would do it through Paypal because Paypal makes it so easy and it&#x2019;s not that big of a hit given in terms of commission. It&#x2019;s like 1.5%, 2% depending on how much you are investing every month. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); She emphasized: &#x201C;I happen to like bitcoin and I like the premise behind it a lot.

Currently they have the first 5000 set up and are working on the 2nd 5000 so we should be at $176k soon.\\n\\nMara's market cap is $2.82B at a $30 price. Riot's market cap is $2.7B at a $40 price. SOS has a market cap of $750mil at a $6.5 price.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCompared to Mara:\\n\\n5000 miners: SOS's revenue is 27% of Mara's. 27% of Mara's market cap is $0.77B. $0.77B divided by 115mil outstanding SOS shares is a share price of $6.63.\\n\\n10000 miners: SOS's revenue is 54% of Mara's. Expected share price is $13.25 using the math above.\\n\\nAll miners: SOS's revenue is 85% of Mara's. Expected share price: $20.68.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nCompared to Riot:\\n\\n5000 miners: SOS's revenue is 26% of Riot's. (Same math as above) Expected share price: $6.02.\\n\\n10000 miners: SOS's revenue is 51% of Riot's. Expected share price: $12.03\\n\\nAll miners: SOS's revenue is 80% of Riot's. Expected share price: $18.77.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThese estimates only take mining revenue into account, it doesn't account for the other businesses SOS is doing nor does it account for the like $300M - $500M of cash SOS is supposed to have on hand, mainly because I don't know how much cash MARA and RIOT have on hand.  But as you can see we're fairly valued for only having 5000 miners online.  When the PR hits that we have 10,000 miners online our value based on fundamentals will jump to $12-$13.\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSStock/comments/lyocqm/sos_expected_stock_price_comparing_hashrates_to/', 'lyocqm', [['u/Gainzzzxz', 27, '2021-03-06 00:14', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSStock/comments/lyocqm/sos_expected_stock_price_comparing_hashrates_to/gptun8a/', 'Im a retard, everytime I see Sos I like', 'lyocqm'], ['u/Third-I-Vision', 18, '2021-03-06 00:16', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSStock/comments/lyocqm/sos_expected_stock_price_comparing_hashrates_to/gptuvvf/', 'This is some good research! thank you for it!', 'lyocqm'], ['u/BagBoyEntertainment', 27, '2021-03-06 00:16', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSStock/comments/lyocqm/sos_expected_stock_price_comparing_hashrates_to/gptuvzl/', 'If it wasn’t for “lies”enburg, sos would have probably steam rolled $13 a week ago.', 'lyocqm'], ['u/[deleted]', 14, '2021-03-06 01:16', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SOSStock/comments/lyocqm/sos_expected_stock_price_comparing_hashrates_to/gpu1iin/', \"We should take electricity cost into account right?

The short-covering fiasco seen in GameStop Corp.'s (NYSE: GME ) stock appears to have little to no impact. Placer.AI On GameStop: Shares of GameStop traded near the $500 per share mark on Jan. 28, but foot traffic trends at GameStop stores nationwide were worsening, according to data provided to Benzinga from foot traffic analytics firm Placer.ai. Weekly visits at GameStop stores for the week of Jan. 4 were down 12.5% year-over-year. Traffic trends deteriorated through the end of the month, as visits were down 16.1% year-over-year the following week and down 19% the week thereafter. Coinciding with the peak of GameStop's stock, traffic was down 20.3% year-over-year for the week of Jan. 25, according to Placer.ai. For the full month of January, monthly visits were down 16.8% year-over-year. Related Link: The Rise And Fall Of Meme Stocks Gravy Analytics On GameStop: Data from Gravy Analytics, a provider of real-world location intelligence data, leads to a similar conclusion: GameStop's soaring stock had no impact on foot traffic trends. GameStop's foot traffic trends briefly trended above zero during the holiday season, but any year-over-year gains were short-lived, according to data provided to Benzinga. GameStop's traffic trends amid the stock's peak were down from the prior week. For the seven-day period starting Jan. 17, weekly visits were down 34% from the prior period. Time will tell if GameStop's same-store sales or e-commerce sales will have seen an impact from the stock surge. GameStop did not respond to requests for comment for this story.

Huobi Thailand will provide Thai users with secure and reliable digital asset trading services through Huobi Clouds verified technical capabilities. In the field of digital asset trading, Huobi is one of the largest exchanges in the world by trading volume and has accumulated six years of experience in safe operation. After entering Thailand, Huobi will also actively cooperate with the government and local enterprises to explore the application scenarios of blockchain,\" said by Sakda, head of Huobi Thailand. In the last two years, Thailand has improved legislation on digital assets to provide a safe investment environment for investors. In May 2018, SEC, Thailand's digital assets regulator, announced that all companies in Thailand involved in digital asset business would only operate after receiving the license. It also required existing companies with related businesses to submit applications for licenses within 90 days. In January, after four months of approval period, Bitcoin Exchange, Bitkub Online, Satang Corporation and a digital asset broker successfully received the licenses, while the applications of three other companies were denied. On May 14, the Royal Decree on Digital Asset Businesses B.E. 2561 (2018) (hereinafter referred to as the Royal Decree) went into effect. The Decree, which consists of 100 sections, clearly defines and classifies of digital assets, the business scope of virtual currency, and the subject and authority of supervision. In addition, the Decree also outlines strict prohibition against insider trading and market manipulation, and sets punishments for violators. Story continues When considering license applicants, the regulators focus on whether the applicant has a sound management system, the background of board and management team members, whether there is a monitoring system to detect conflicts of interest, and whether there is a routine cyber security check, etc. Obtaining a license requires the approval of the regulatory commission, who usually only makes it once a month. In addition to regulated exchanges, Thailands government is also actively exploring the other blockchain applications. In August, the Bank of Thailand announced the development of Intanon, its official virtual currency. Intanon would be based on the distributed ledger technology developed by R3 and CORDA platform, which aimed to use blockchain technology to improve the efficiency of interbank payments. Eight commercial banks in Thailand, including Standard Chartered Bank of Thailand and HSBC, announced support for the project. As one of the world's leading digital asset service providers, Huobi has a deep global layout with licenses and compliance teams across a number of regions. Its strategic partner in the United States holds a MSB as well as MTL licenses in 12 states. In Japan, Huobi has obtained No.0007 exchange license.

Per the report, Bitfinexs chief technology officer Paolo Ardoino told the outlet that the company plans to launch USDT on LN later this year. To pursue this objective, the firm reportedly joined the RGB open source development project. According to its GitHub repository , the RGB project is a completely free, open-source, non-profit and community-oriented effort, promoted by the BHB Network and aimed at the development of standards and best practices to issue, transmit and store Bitcoin-based non-bitcoin assets. The Block also cited Ardoino commenting on the development, saying it is one of the coolest things the firm has participated in thus far. The companys CTO further noted  Bitfinex wants to contribute to the LNs development. A post released by Tether in April 2017 shows that the company already had such plans for the stablecoin at the time. As Cointelegraph reported earlier this week, Tether has announced that it is partnering with EOS parent company Block.one to release its stablecoin on the EOS blockchain. Recently news broke that social media giant Facebook has reportedly held talks with major United States -based crypto exchanges about the issuance of its long-rumored stablecoin dubbed Globalcoin.

And [hotlink]Bank of America[/hotlink] certainly isn’t missing out. Coming off a huge year for tech and growth stocks in 2020, the bank is now looking at stocks that are poised to benefit as the world gets back to normal and inflation starts to pick up once more. Indeed, some market prognosticators are expecting rates (and the 10-year Treasury yield) to rise higher—and faster—than some on the Street expect . “If we go to 2% [10-year yield] by May, you’re going to see growth go through another bout of real pain, and you’re going to see further acceleration into this value trade,” Morgan Stanley’s senior portfolio manager Andrew Slimmon recently told Fortune. “I think the rotation will continue.” Whether or not rates get to that level in two months, strategists at Bank of America argue that inflation is coming, as they wrote in a Monday report. The BofA strategists suggest that the market is now “mid-cycle” where inflation is typically stronger (see BofA’s chart). “In this phase,” the strategists wrote, “small caps and value have typically outperformed large caps and growth—further supported by the profits recovery and economic rebound we expect this year.” BofA’s reasoning is based not only on rising inflation expectations but also the current political regime. “After years of low inflation and oligopolistic trends within the equity market in which larger companies have continued to take share (contributing to peak income and wealth inequality and suppressing wages in recent decades), this could finally be reversing given pro–small-business sentiment and a focus on social/income equality by the Biden administration, along with potential regulation and anti-monopolistic sentiment in areas like Big Tech,” the strategists wrote. Though small-caps have done well lately (The Russell 2000 is up 19% so far this year), they are still about 10% cheaper than large-caps based on forward price-to-earnings, BofA wrote. And within small-caps, areas like energy and materials are still trading inexpensively based on historical levels. Story continues 7 stocks for the next phase BofA strategists outlined a group of stocks that “appear poised to benefit from both the recovery (exposed to reopening/services spend or capex) and reflation (inflation beneficiary with pricing power or margin drivers), and where valuation isn’t stretched.” Here are seven of the bank’s picks. BofA analysts like Comcast , as it should benefit from a return to theme parks and production of shows and films; Disney , with pent-up demand for its theme parks and exposure to the reopening of theaters; Marriott , which should benefit from inflation “as higher room rates and revenues pass through to the company’s fee-based model,” per the BofA analyst; Hess , a preferred oil and gas player to the bank; Principal Financial , which, as a life insurer, is “generally positively correlated to inflation,” the analysts note; Emerson Electric , which should be a “key” beneficiary of a rebound in oil prices; and Broadcom , as it’s poised to benefit from the reopening of enterprise spending and the continued rollout of 5G.

Ian Shepherdson, chief U.S. economist for the forecasting firm Pantheon , thinks that complacency is due to the anemic pace of price increases in recent years. The same thing happened in the early 1960s  just before the double-digit inflation that spilled into the 1970s, he wrote in a report Monday. Related: Performers' Dance Moves Turned Into Animated NFTs for Games and Apps That potential rise in inflation this time may be caused by the $1.9 trillion fiscal stimulus package recently signed into law by U.S. President Joe Biden as well as near-constant money printing by the Federal Reserve. Our point here is that it is possible that the U.S. is now on the verge of a major shift in inflation to the upside, from a starting point almost as low  and with low expectations as deeply embedded  as in the mid-sixties, he wrote. The current pace of consumer price increases isnt remotely troubling, at less than 2%. However, there are investors who are concerned, as evidenced by their buying bitcoin as a hedge. While not specifically mentioning bitcoin, he warned, Very few of todays bond portfolio managers and traders can remember the last inflation shock, but that does not make a new shock less likely. Related: Bitcoin News Roundup for March 16, 2021 Consider what happened 60 years ago, Shepherdson writes: The inflation trigger in the second half of the 1960s was the cost of the Vietnam War and President Lyndon B. Johnsons Great Society domestic spending, according to Shepherdson. Later, the price increases accelerated due to the oil price shocks of the first half of the 1970s as well as loose Federal Reserve monetary policy. Core consumer price inflation (CPI), which excludes food and energy, rose from 1.3% in 1965 to 3.5% in 1967, and then powered on to 6.2% in 1970  a shock to investors who failed to position for higher inflation. Then it happened all over again, as core inflation rocketed to new highs, peaking at 11.7% in February 1975, Shepherdson wrote. By the time of the third inflation surprise, in [1979-1980], investors were much wiser. Core inflation was even higher than in 1975, peaking at 13.3% in May 1980, and the recession was deeper. The trigger for higher inflation this time around could be the gigantic fiscal response to the COVID-19 pandemic, according to Shepherdson. While an inflation shock similar to that of the 1960s doesnt happen often, one may be long overdue. Investors usually expect tomorrow to look like today, so major shifts [such as inflation] are often downplayed for too long, Shepherdson wrote. We cant go back and read the minds of the owners of [Treasury bonds] in 1964, but were h...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[62628, 'altcoins-spike-to-new-highs-while-bitcoin-bulls-aim-to-recapture-57k', 46578, 'Altcoins spike to new highs while Bitcoin bulls aim to recapture $57K', '2021-03-16 22:05:00', 'Terra (LUNA), Basic Attention Token and Cardano spiked to new highs as Bitcoin and Ethereum attempted to recover from their recent correction.

Prince, who is the co-CIO at Bridgewater Associates, links this looming downturn in the $21 trillion Treasury market to the improving economy as well, as growing inflation pressurizes. These two factors according to Prince could &#x201C;push the Federal Reserve to consider reeling back its stimulus measures.&#x201D; Still, as one report explains, the Federal Reserve policymakers are &#x201C;brushing off the Treasury sell-off as a healthy reaction to the budding U.S. economic recovery.&#x201D; However, Prince asserts that this &#x201C;surge in cryptocurrencies like bitcoin is a manifestation of that environment created by the loose monetary policy of the US central bank and stimulus provided by the U.S. Congress.&#x201D; if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Meanwhile, the report says U.S. inflation expectations have picked up this year, hitting the price of government bonds and pumping up their yields. This in turn has already &#x201C;hit fast-growing technology companies such as Netflix, Amazon, and Tesla since their elevated valuations have been underpinned by low rates.&#x201D; In the meantime, the same report also explains that foreign investors, one of the biggest buyers of Treasuries after the Fed, have already shown less appetite for U.S. sovereign debt as their losses have piled up. The yield on the 10-year Treasury recently climbed above 1.6 percent from 0.9 percent at the end of last year.

Instead of the former concern over Covid-19, the current number one risk to markets is inflation, as federal stimulus spending has invoked worry among investors. While Inflation Concerns Grow, Mainstream Media Publications Tell Americans Not to Worry Just recently, Jerome Powell, the Federal Reserve Chairman, showed little concern about rising inflation and never really said when the Fed&#x2019;s monetary easing policies would end. After Powell did an interview at a Wall Street Journal Jobs Summit and showed no signs of worry, 10-year U.S. bond note markets saw a massive sell-off. Following the market carnage on March 4, 2021, a number of mainstream media publications simply wrote off people who are concerned about inflation. Specifically, that day, Bloomberg economics editor Peter Coy wrote an editorial called &#x201C;Tune Out the Hyperinflation Hype. It&#x2019;s Just Meme Economics.&#x201D; The editorial passes off the concerns as &#x201C;hype,&#x201D; and coupled the proposition with the overused term &#x201C;conspiracy theories.&#x201D; Coy even noted that fear of inflation helps the leading crypto asset bitcoin (BTC). &#x201C;Conspiracy theories have an insidious way of seeping into the real world,&#x201D; Coy&#x2019;s editorial explains. &#x201C;Fear of inflation&#x2014;if not outright hyperinflation&#x2014;helps explain the meteoric rise of Bitcoin,&#x201D; the Bloomberg economics editor&#x2019;s report adds. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Bank of America Survey&#x2019;s 220 Investors Managing $630B AUM- Inflation Considered the Biggest &#x2018;Tail Risk&#x2019; Over Covid-19 Concerns Now, according to the latest survey from Bank of America (BoA), which surveyed 220 fund managers with assets over $630 billion assets under management (AUM), &#x201C;higher than expected inflation&#x201D; is a big risk to markets. Participants in the BoA survey noted for the first time in over a year, inflation is more concerning than the coronavirus outbreak when it comes to the future of the economy. After the craziness in bond markets, 35% of the fund managers surveyed said U.S. Treasury bond yields were the second biggest risk. For the first time since February 2020, the coronavirus is no longer in the first position as inflation concerns take the lead. 37% of the 220 fund managers with $630 billion AUM said that inflation is the number one &#x201C;tail risk&#x201D; for investment markets right now. Additionally, some participants were concerned about a possible surprise monetary tightening policy from the U.S. central bank. Despite the &#x2018;meme economics&#x2019; commentary and so-called &#x2018;conspiracy theories,&#x2019; 93% of BoA&#x2019;s surveyed participants said they expect inflation to rise in 2021. Even though a drop in purchasing power is expected, close to half of the BoA surveyed fund managers are optimistic about the global economy seeing a &#x201C;V-shaped recovery.&#x201D; This has caused investors to seek an allocation in commodities as opposed to certain tech stocks the BoA report notes. An executive at the foreign exchange company OANDA says that Jerome Powell and the Federal Reserve still have some time before the summer comes to deal with inflation concerns. &#x201C;Powell will likely replay his best hits when discussing inflation, noting that price increases later in the year won&#x2019;t be large or persistent,&#x201D; Edward Moya, senior market analyst at OANDA explained on March 15. &#x201C;The summertime is when inflation could rear its ugly head, so Powell should be able to push back any concerns until then,&#x201D; the analyst added.

Thanks to the drop in Tesla Inc's (NASDAQ: TSLA ), whose stock fell 2.4% on Wednesday, the founder of Amazon Inc. (NASDAQ: AMZN ) regained his place at the top of the worlds richest people chart, according to the Bloomberg Billionaires Index. With a personal fortune of $191 billion, Bezos stands up to Elon Musk ($190 billion), who ranked number one for six weeks. Musk's rise to number one took place in early January, when Tesla's shares rose 743% over the year, with a $106 billion increase. The Other Fat Cats: Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ: MSFT ) co-founder Bill Gates has a net worth of $137 billion, thanks to which he took the third place in the ranking, followed by LVMH Moet Hennessy Louis Vuitton SA (OTC: LVMUY ) CEO Bernard Arnault with $116 billion, and Facebook Inc. (NASDAQ: FB ) CEO Mark Zuckerberg, ranking fifth thanks to his $104 billion. Space Challenge: This is a challenge by means of equity destined to move into orbit. In fact, the two richest people also own two aerospace research companies: Blue Origin and SpaceX. On February 2nd, Bezos stepped down from his role as CEO of Amazon to pursue his other activities, and referring to Blue Origin he said: This is the most important job I am doing. See Also: Elon Musk's SpaceX Gets 60% Higher Valuation In Latest Funding Round At B: Report Blue Origin will be wrestling with Musk's Space X, which has managed to establish itself in recent years.

Subscribe Why Wall Street is calling for no recession in 2020 In 2019, the word on the tip of everyone’s tongue was “recession.” A U.S.-China trade war, an inverted yield curve , and the length of the expansion were just a few of the concerns cited by investors who were still skittish following the market’s worst year since the crisis. But easier Fed policy , a softening in the trade war, and better-than-feared economic data helped power the stock market’s best year since 2013. And as we enter a new decade, economists across Wall Street are starting to discount not only a recession in 2020, but in the years ahead. In a note to clients published last week, economists at Goldman Sachs answered the 10 most pressing economic questions heading into the new year. Among them: Will the economy enter recession in 2020? “No,” Goldman writes. “While trade war-related recession fears have faded in financial markets, broader worries remain,” the firm adds. “The current expansion is now the longest in US history, and some recession fears may simply reflect an instinctive sense that its time must surely be almost up. This has not been an unreasonable thought historically, as the two usual late-cycle risks — inflationary overheating and financial imbalances — often did grow over time. But so far both risks look limited.” Fed chair Jerome Powell has stressed in recent public comments that inflation pressures have been “unexpectedly muted” relative to the Fed’s 2% target. And until there is a material pickup in inflation, Powell expects the Fed’s “somewhat accommodative” policy stance will remain in play. When it comes to financial imbalances, data has consistently shown this economic cycle to be one of consumer deleveraging. And with consumer spending accounting for about 70% of GDP, the relative financial health of consumers is tantamount to the health of the economy. Story continues Though as Deutsche Bank’s chief international economist Torsten Sløk notes, corporates have also exhibited a similar caution compared to history. This further suggests this economic cycle — though it is up there in years — shows few signs of breaking down. “This expansion has been characterized by an extreme degree of caution among consumers and corporates,” Sløk said in a note published this weekend. “Because of the experience in 2008-2009, households and companies have been hesitant to spend too much money and take too much risk. As a result, ten years into this expansion, discretionary spending for consumers and corporates is still below its historical average.” Consumer and corporate discretionary spending has remained depressed since the crisis, indicating caution and relative financial stability as we enter the new year. (Source: Deutsche Bank) Sløk notes that consumer caution is “highly unusual” compared to the economic cycles we’ve grown accustomed to seeing since World War II. “The lack of willingness to spend on consumer durables and corporate capex is also the reason why this expansion has been so weak,” Sløk adds. “And it is also the reason why this expansion could continue for many more years; we are simply less vulnerable to shocks in 2020 because there are few imbalances in the economy.” By Myles Udland , reporter and co-anchor of The Final Round.

Repeated defense of the EMA could attract technical buying. The average had acted as strong support in the five months to October 2018. A UTC close above $7,870 is needed to confirm a short-term bullish reversal. A violation at the EMA support could yield a re-test of recent lows near $6,500. Bitcoin is still feeling bearish pressure and could soon drop to historically strong price support below $7,100. The cryptocurrency fell 1.7 percent on Tuesday, reinforcing the bearish view put forward by the strong rejection above $7,600 witnessed over the weekend. The longer term picture is also looking bleak. Bitcoin is currently down 48 percent from the June high of $13,880 and is reporting nearly a 13 percent drop on a quarter-to-date basis, according to Bitstamp data. Related: Is Greece Cracking Down on Tax Evasion or Taxing Anonymity? With the sellers in control, bitcoin looks set to re-test the 21-month exponential moving average (EMA), currently at $7,097. The EMA had acted as strong support in the five months to October 2018, as seen below. Monthly chart (2017-2018) Bitcoins sell-off from the record high of $20,000 reached in December 2017 ran out of steam at the 21-month EMA support in June 2018. In the following four months, sellers repeatedly failed to secure a monthly close below the average line. By mid-October, many were convinced that the cryptocurrency had bottomed out along the key level. Buyers, however, remained elusive and the average support, then located around $6,100, was convincingly breached in mid-November with high volumes. The violation of the support likely triggered stops on long positions, leading to a violent sell-off. Related: Bitcoin Looks South After Strong Rejection Above $7,600 Clearly, the 21-month EMA, currently at $7,097, is the level to watch out for in the near-term  more so, as the bears have recently struggled to breach the support. Story continues Monthly chart (2019) The long-tail attached to Octobers candle indicates sellers faded near the 21-month EMA line. Prices did print lows below the crucial support last month, but the support remained intact on a monthly closing basis (Nov. 30, UTC). Decembers candle has already briefly defended the support. A week ago, the technical line held ground resulting in a price bounce that fizzled out at highs above $7,660 on Dec. 9. Ifthe EMA continues to restrict losses, chart-driven buying could be seen,leading to a notable price bounce. That said, the short-term outlook will turn bullish only above $7,870. At press time, bitcoin is changing hands at $7,200 on Bitstamp. Daily and weekly chart A UTC close above the Nov. 29 high of $7,870 would invalidate the lower-highs setup on the daily chart (above left) and confirm a short-term bullish reversal. However, the odds are currently stacked in favor of a move lower, as suggested by Mondays outside day candle and Tuesdays bearish follow-through. A break below the 21-month EMA support at $7, 097 will likely yield a decline to recent lows near $6,500. Thelong-term outlook would turn bullish if and when the cryptocurrency witnesses afalling channel breakout on the weekly chart.

{"instruction": "Solve this math problem and provide detailed calculation steps:", "input": "How many three-digit integers can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on a calculator with the numbers 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 on them?", "output": "To create a three-digit integer, we need to select 3 different numbers from the 6 available (0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5) and arrange them in a sequence where the first digit cannot be 0 (since that would make it a two-digit number).\n\nFirst, we select 3 different numbers from the 6 available. This can be done in \\( \\binom{6}{3} \\) ways, which is the number of combinations of 6 things taken 3 at a time. The formula for combinations is \\( \\binom{n}{r} = \\frac{n!}{r!(n-r)!} \\), where \\( n! \\) denotes the factorial of n.\n\nSo, \\( \\binom{6}{3} = \\frac{6!}{3!(6-3)!} = \\frac{6 \\times 5 \\times 4}{3 \\times 2 \\times 1} = 20 \\) ways.\n\nNow, for each of these combinations, we need to arrange them into a three-digit number. However, we must remember that the first digit cannot be 0. So, for each combination, we have two cases:\n\n1. If the combination includes the number 0, we have 2 choices for the first digit (any of the other two numbers), and then 2 choices for the second digit (the remaining number or 0), and finally 1 choice for the last digit (whichever number is left). This gives us \\( 2 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 4 \\) arrangements for each combination that includes 0.\n\n2. If the combination does not include the number 0, we have 3 choices for the first digit, 2 choices for the second digit, and 1 choice for the last digit. This gives us \\( 3 \\times 2 \\times 1 = 6 \\) arrangements for each combination that does not include 0.\n\nTo find out how many of the 20 combinations include the number 0, we can calculate it as follows: We have 1 choice for the number 0, and then we need to choose 2 more numbers from the remaining 5 numbers. This can be done in \\( \\binom{5}{2} \\) ways.\n\n\\( \\binom{5}{2} = \\frac{5!}{2!(5-2)!} = \\frac{5 \\times 4}{2 \\times 1} = 10 \\) ways.\n\nSo, there are 10 combinations that include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 4 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 4 = 40 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nThe remaining \\( 20 - 10 = 10 \\) combinations do not include the number 0, and each of these can be arranged in 6 ways, giving us \\( 10 \\times 6 = 60 \\) three-digit numbers.\n\nAdding these together, we get \\( 40 + 60 = 100 \\) three-digit integers that can be created by pressing 3 of the 6 buttons on the calculator."}

Bond yields soared, with the 10-year US Treasury spiking 18 basis points to 4.546%.\nInflation rose 3.5% on an annual basis in March, slightly hotter than the 3.4% increase economists were expecting. Core inflation, which excludes volatile food and energy prices, grew 3.8% year-per-year, hotter than the expected 3.7% increase.\nInflation has come in higher than expected for the past three months, which has undercut investors' expectations for Fed rate cuts this year.Odds of a June rate cuthave fallen to 16%, according to the CME FedWatch tool, down from 56% odds priced in on Tuesday.\nBank of America maintained its outlook for a June rate cut but said it had \"low confidence,\" given the latest CPI data. Barclays revised its outlook to just one 25 basis-point rate cut later this year, down from its initial forecast of one rate cut every other month. Goldman Sachs said it was adjusting its view to two cuts from three, asinsurance costs keep inflation running hot.\n\"The Federal Reserve will have to wait even longer for evidence confirming that gains in fighting price pressures are durable before it turns accommodative,\" José Torres, a senior economist at Interactive Brokers, said in a statement. \"Today's report reflects that progress on inflation has reversed, with goods and commodities turning from a disinflationary friend to an inflationary foe.\"\nAs of last month's policy meeting, Fed officials were still projecting three rate cuts to come in 2024. But newly released minutes of the Fed's March policy meeting show that central bankers remain cautious on the recent uptrend in inflation.\nOfficials commented on \"disappointing\" inflation readings over the past several months, adding they \"did not expect it would be appropriate\" to lower rates until there was greater confidence inflation was back on track to reach 2%, the minutes said.\n\"The Fed always puts more weight on backward-looking data, and this Fed, in particular, is still scarred by the 'transitory' inflation fiasco,\" Ian Shepherdson, the chief economist of Pantheon Macroeconomics said in a note on Wednesday. \"The risk that the Fed waits too long and moves too slowly is rising.\"\nHere's where US indexes stood at the 4 p.m. closing bell on Wednesday:\n• S&P

to cut interest rates to lower inflation, one JPMorgan strategist says.\n• Stocks are headed for a decade-long \"dead\" zonewith losses on par with the dot-com bust, one fund manager warns.\n• The demise of the US dollar has been over-exaggerated.\n• Wall Street'snew biggest stock bull thinks tech can power the S&P 500 another 7% higherthis year.\n• Nvidia still has 26% upsidedespite its recent

said in an email note.\n\"[Still] The drop of -2% from Monday's retest of $73,000 showcases risk assets, including BTC, pricing in two rate cuts instead of three for the remainder of 2024,\" he added.\nBettors on decentralized predictions platform Polymarketseem to be evenly split on the number of rate cuts by the end of 2024.\nTwenty-six percent of bettors have put money on there being one cut, while 28% believe there will be two cuts, and 21% bet on no cuts at all.\nMeanwhile, Jun-Young Heo, a derivative trader at Singapore-based Presto, pointed out that the market recovered quickly after the higher-than-expected CPI announcement compared to gold or the S&P 500 index.\nThe implied volatility of options expiring on April 26th is still trading at a premium while recent historical volatility is still trending down, Heo noted.\nSome market participants are noting that bitcoin prices are reacting favorably to slower than usualoutflows from the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC).\nOn-chain data shows that outflow from GBTC is at $18 million, which is the lowest since the launch of the U.S. bitcoin ETFs.\n\"But we need to see a few more dates to find out whether GBTC outflows are becoming negligible amount since it has a higher fee than any other ETFs,\" Heo added. || Cryfi is a marketplace and trading platform that offersblockchain-verified tradingsignalsand a

As anticipated by analysts, the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) chose to keep the benchmark federal funds rate within the range of 5.25% to 5.50%, marking the first pause in rate adjustments in 2024.\nThe central bankaffirmedits commitment to maintaining the target range for the federal funds rate, citing its goals and the need for greater confidence in sustainable inflation movement before considering a rate reduction.\nDuring the FOMC, the Federal Reserve recognized the strength of job gains and the low unemployment rate, although it acknowledged that inflation, while eased over the past year, remained elevated. The committee aims to achieve maximum employment and a 2% inflation rate in the long run. Market expectations, as indicated by the CME FedWatch Tool, now anticipate at least one rate cut by the FOMC meeting on July 31, with rates potentially 50 to 100 basis points lower by the end of 2024.\nFollowing the FOMC meeting,Bitcoin (BTC)gained 7.7% over the past 24 hours, reaching $67,700. Despite surpassing previous all-time highs, BTC fell by 7.2% over the past week, after outflows from spot Bitcoin ETFs and higher-than-expected inflation data pushed the price down to $61,000.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":67526.13,\"take_profit\":73649.64,\"forecast_10d\":[67195.87, 63821.47, 65738.73, 63426.21, 63811.86, 61276.69, 63512.75, 63843.57, 64994.44, 64926.64]}"}

The benchmark index has climbed over 14% in the first half of 2021 and is up roughly 27% from its pre-pandemic levels in February 2020. This helps provide more context for where Wall Street is at the moment and might help ease some worries that the market is super overheated.\nThe Nasdaq has also soared back to new highs to end Q2, with the technology-heavy index up roughly 12% since May 12. Wall Street has used every pullback and healthy recalibration in big tech as a chance to buy their favorite stocks, from titans such as Microsoft MSFT and Adobe ADBE to countless growth names, at discounts.\nWall Street has driven stocks to highs amid the low volume summer in the face of inflation fears. The market has seemingly shrugged off the possibility of higher interest rates and the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury note has actually slipped back to 1.47% from 1.75% in late March.\nThe ability to look beyond rising prices amid the booming U.S. economy could mean Wall Street understands thatthere is no alternativeinvesting won’t end anytime soon, with interest rates set to remain historically low even when the Fed begins to lift them. This means investors will likely be left chasing returns in equities for the foreseeable future.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe growth is, of course, supported by the resurgent U.S. economy and the impressive S&P 500 earnings picture that is expected to keep getting better (also read: Q2 Earnings Growth Reflects More Than Easy Comps).\nAll that said, some investors might be hesitant to buy stocks with the market at new highs, and there are clearly valid reasons to avoid doing so. But timing the market is extremely difficult and trying to do so can lead to buying high and selling low and missing out on comebacks.\nInstead, long-term investors, with horizons of a year or longer are often better suited buying strong stocks and staying constantly exposed to the market even during dips and corrections, which are healthy and common. Today we dive into two stocks poised to grow in a world dominated by technology that might be worth buying in Q3 and beyond…\nRoku ROKU\nThe pandemic cemented streaming TV as the future of entertainment in the U.S. and beyond, after its ascendance helped Netflix NFLX become one of the star stocks of the last decade. In the last several years, Apple AAPL and Disney DIS have stormed into the streaming market to take on NFLX, Amazon AMZN, and others. Disney already crushed its own subscriber goals and laid out a lofty new path and Netflix has amassed over 200 million subscribers worldwide.\nClearly, streaming is a space Wall Street wants to cash in on and Roku is one of the only pure-play streaming stocks not named Netflix. The company rose to prominence on the back of its small devices that plug into TVs and allow users to watch streaming TV content. Roku’s tech is also built into smart TVs, and it was the No. 1 smart TV OS sold in the U.S. in 2020, with nearly 40% market share.\nRoku’s hardware is strong, but it became a Wall Street standout because of its ability to sell ad space across its marketplace, taking a piece of streaming service subscription revenue, ad inventory, and more. Roku allows marketers to buy targeted ads, which is crucial since eMarketer projects digital will account for 65% of the roughly $240 billion-a-year ad industry in the U.S. by 2023, up from around one-third a few years ago.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nThe company also has a Roku Channel that enables users to watch free, ad-supported streaming movies and TV shows. And it boosted its platform with its purchase of the streaming rights to the short-form shows the now-defunct Quibi created.\nFurthermore, Roku bought Nielsen's Advanced Video Advertising business and “entered into a long-term strategic partnership” with the historic marketing research firm and media data giant to further boost its advertising bona fides.\nRoku topped our Q1 estimates in May, with revenue up 78%. And its +$0.54 a share adjusted earnings blew away our bottom-line estimate that called for a -$0.12 loss.The growth wasdriven by its ad-heavy platform revenue that skyrocketed 101% to account for 80% of total sales and it added 2.4 million active accounts to close at 53.6 million. Investors should know Roku’s monetized video ad impressions more than doubled YoY.\nLooking ahead, Zacks estimates call for Roku’s FY21 revenue to surge 53% from $1.8 billion to $2.7 billion, with it set to add another $1 billion, or 39% to end 2022 at $3.8 billion. These estimates would follow 58% top-line growth in 2020, 52% in FY19, and 45% in 2018.\nAt the bottom end, Roku is projected to swing from an adjusted loss of -$0.14 a share to +$0.37 this year, with FY22 set to soar 161% $0.97 a share.\nRoku currently lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold), alongside an “A” grade for Growth in Style Scores system. And 16 of the 20 brokerage recommendations Zacks has are “Strong Buys.” ROKU shares have surged 260% in the past year, as part of a much larger run, and it has rebounded right near its February records on the back of a 50% climb since May 12.\nThe resurgence has pushed the stock above overbought RSI territory of 70, which could mean it’s in for a pullback. Therefore, some investors might want to wait for a more enticing possible entry point. But Roku appears like a strong long-term tech buy that’s poised to grow no matter who wins the streaming wars, and it boasts a solid balance sheet.\nSnap Inc. SNAP\nSnap has continually enhanced its social media app that became famous for disappearing photos and videos. Today, Snapchat is full of video content and shows from social media stars to celebrities like Kevin Hart, as well as mega brands like the NFL, Disney, and many others.\nSnapchat’s Discover page has gained traction and it’s been in the booming mobile gaming market for over two years. The company also constantly releases various augmented reality offerings and it launched its Spotlight feature late last year that aims to challenge TikTok.\nSnap’s beefed-up portfolio of entertainment offerings has attracted advertisers as more people disconnect from ad-supported legacy media and simply ignore more traditional online banner ads. Investors should also know that Snap has boasted that in the U.S. it reaches “more than 90% of 13-to-24-year-olds and more than 75% of 13-to-34-year-olds.”\nSnap’s ability to reach this “unduplicated and hard-to-reach audience” has attracted Wall Street’s attention, as it continues to add users and monetize its growing platform, as Facebook FB and other giants face government scrutiny. Snap beat our first quarter estimates, with revenue up 66% and its daily active users up 22% to 280 million. Plus, it posted break-even earnings to top our estimate that called for a loss of -$0.06 a share.\nSnap’s FY21 and FY22 earnings estimates surged since its report, with some positive revisions recently as well. Zacks estimates call for Snap’s FY21 revenue to surge 56% to reach $3.9 billion, with FY22 projected to climb another 49% to $5.8 billion. These estimates would represent its best growth as a public company and follow three-straight years of between 43% to 46% revenue expansion.\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\nMeanwhile, Snap is expected to soar from an adjusted loss of -$0.06 last year to +$0.23 a share in FY21, with 2022 set to skyrocket 200% to +$0.69 a share. And the company has blown away Zacks bottom-line estimates in the trailing four periods.\nSnap lands a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold) at the moment, next to an “A” grade for Growth. Like Roku, Wall Street is high on Snap, with 20 of the 25 brokerage recommendations Zacks at “Strong Buys,” with none below a “Hold.”\nSNAP has climbed 190% in the past year, but it fell victim to the growth selling that began in February. Luckily, it has mounted a big comeback, up over 30% since mid-May.\nThe stock closed regular hours Wednesday just off its records at around $68 a share. Despite trading near its records, its trades well below its year-long highs of 27X forward sales at 21.3X. And it still rests below overbought RSI levels at 65.\nClearly, there could be more selling pressure with the Nasdaq at fresh highs. And some might want to wait for Snap to report its Q2 earnings. Of course, as we touched on, investors with long-term outlooks might want to buy Snap now given its ability to constantly evolve its modern media platform that plays into overall smartphone addiction, while attracting a vital demographic in the new age of entertainment.\nBitcoin, Like the Internet Itself, Could Change EverythingBlockchain and cryptocurrency has sparked one of the most exciting discussion topics of a generation. Some call it the “Internet of Money” and predict it could change the way money works forever. If true, it could do to banks what Netflix did to Blockbuster and Amazon did to Sears. Experts agree we’re still in the early stages of this technology, and as it grows, it will create several investing opportunities.Zacks’ has just revealed 3 companies that can help investors capitalize on the explosive profit potential of Bitcoin and the other cryptocurrencies with significantly less volatility than buying them directly.See 3 crypto-related stocks now >>\nWant the latest recommendations from Zacks Investment Research?

That means investors lined up to offer more than the mining company was seeking at this time, an indication of investor confidence in Blockware’s operations.\\nIn previous rounds, the bitcoin mining firm raised a total of $7 million in funds. That brings its total accumulation of privately equity placements to $32 million.\\nKentucky enjoys some of the lowest industrial energy costs for electricity in the United States. That’s good for a business in an industry with a bottom line that’s notoriously sensitive to the rise and fall of energy prices.\\nLast month, Stoltzner told Kentucky Today:\\n“Obviously, for bitcoin mining your power usage is a large percentage of your operating costs. So we were looking for a location that gave us favorable power rates and on top of that to acquire land that was in good proximity to a substation.”\\nBlockware claimed that one key to their success has been its strong efforts to make inroads with local authorities as it builds operations in the Commonwealth of Kentucky.\\nEarlier this week, we reported that Bitcoin and other cryptocurrency miners are currently fleeing China after Beijeng’s crackdown on mining operations there.

Damodaran specifically cites Bitcoin’s limited use in microtransactions, even though El Salvador is pushing forward with a plan to democratize the Lightning Network solution.Bulls have a better chance of winning the weekly expiryAfter bears had a victory in the recent quarterly $3-billion options expiry on Friday, the winds may have shifted the tide favorably to bulls this time around.

Source: BybtThe initial picture paints a neutral structure, with the neutral-to-positive call options open interest dominating by 8% as per the call-to-put ratio. Out of the $445 million in open interest, $230 million is represented by the neutral-to-bullish call options, which gives a slight advantage to bulls. However, looking at more granular data provides a different angle.Related: Crypto traders say negative funding rates are buy signals, but are they?Only 18% of the protective put options have been placed at $33,000 or higher strikes. Therefore, if Bitcoin is trading above that level at 8:00 am UTC on Friday, only $38 million worth of those neutral-to-bearish instruments will last.$34,000 is the make-or-break level for both sidesOn the other hand, bulls will likely try to defend the $34,000 level, resulting in $45 million in call (buy) options open interest.Truth to be told, both sides have incentives to break this reasonable equilibrium at $34,000. For example, above $35,000, bulls’ advantage increased from $7 million to $57 million.Conversely, bears have the upper hand if Bitcoin trades below $33,000. In this case, protective put options open interest is $31 million higher than the neutral-to-bullish call options.To sum up, it is impossible to predict whichever side will come out stronger on Friday’s expiry.

Analysts claim the cryptocurrency uses as much as energy as American Airlines ( AAL ), the country of Greece, or the U.S. federal government as mining computers solve math problems to build up its blockchain ledger. However, a new report suggests bitcoin isn't emitting as much as certain pillars of the global economy. Galaxy Digital, a New York-based crypto firm founded by former hedge fund manager Michael Novogratz, says the world's most popular digital currency is using far less juice than banking and gold. \"Bitcoin's energy usage has become an easy target for criticism,\" authors Rachel Rybarczyk, Drew Armstrong and Amanda Fabiano wrote in the report. \"It is easy to estimate Bitcoin's energy usage. This results in frequent criticism of Bitcoin, but these critiques are rarely levied against other traditional industries.\" Galaxy Digital analysis of Bitcoin's energy consumption, versus banking and gold. Indeed, such analysis can be done in real time with resources such as the Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index . It shows rising energy usage beginning in late-2020, as bitcoin's price skyrocketed. Galaxy Digital found the total electricity consumption of the bitcoin network topped 113.89 terawatt-hours (TWh) at the time the report was written. Bitcoin energy consumption by TWh. (Annualized.) A one-year view of bitcoin compared to the Canadian dollar. Quantifying the energy footprint of the financial sector or gold industry is far more challenging. For the banks, Galaxy Digital looked at four key areas of electricity consumption: data centres, bank branches, ATMs, and card network data centres. It estimates the global energy consumption of the banking system is 238.92 TWh per year. For the gold industry, Galaxy Digital relied on greenhouse gas emissions estimates published by the World Gold Council to determine an annual energy usage of 240.61 TWh per year. The authors concede this estimate may omit some key sources of energy use, \"like the energy and carbon intensity of the tires used in gold mines.\" Story continues A report by silver and gold dealer Money Metals looking at hidden sources of energy use in the industry found that Barrick Gold consumed nearly 25,000 tons of rubber tires in 2013 which require oil to produce, for example. \"Viewpoints on Bitcoin's energy consumption range from wasteful to justified to anywhere in between,\" the Galaxy Digital authors wrote. \"On one end, critics believe that Bitcoin is merely a tool for speculation or illicit activity, attached to a network with an unjustifiable environmental cost. On the other, supporters view Bitcoin as a monetary revolution that will be a boon to humanity. We at Galaxy believe in Bitcoin and the broader ecosystem.\" The debate has divided famous observers, with Bill Gates and Warren Buffett taking dim views on bitcoin's value, and Twitter ( TWTR ) chief executive officer Jack Dorsey and Tesla ( TSLA ) boss Elon Musk enthusiastically backing the cryptocurrency. Musk has recently acknowledged bitcoin's large emissions footprint, and stopped accepting it as payment for his cars . His tweets last weekend are said to have sent the price of the cryptocurrency to its lowest level since the end of February, as investors speculated that he may sell his holdings. To be clear, I strongly believe in crypto, but it cant drive a massive increase in fossil fuel use, especially coal  Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 13, 2021 To clarify speculation, Tesla has not sold any Bitcoin  Elon Musk (@elonmusk) May 17, 2021 Looking to cater to investors who share Musk's bullishness for bitcoin, and concerns about emissions, Toronto-based Ninepoint Partners announced it would offer \"carbon neutral exposure to Bitcoin\" through one of its ETFs ( BITC-U.TO ). The firm says it would spend an undisclosed portion of its management fee on offsets. Tom Rand, author of Climate Capitalism , sees this putting pressure on the already tight carbon offsets market for a purpose that adds little economic value from the emissions it creates. He cautions that \"greenwashing\" is a significant risk for climate-conscious investors. \"If you're going to offset, you should be offsetting important economic activity, not bitcoin,\" Rand said . \"The duckers and divers who are making money off of bitcoin want to keep it spinning up. It is absolutely fundamental to the way bitcoin is run that it will always be an energy hog on every transaction.\" Jeff Lagerquist is a senior reporter at Yahoo Finance Canada.

The company continues to outpace Wall Street's expectations , its share price has shot up 78% over the past year, and the company's driverless car opportunities and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies are riding some of the biggest tech trend waves right now. The company's Drive PX Pegasus supercomputer and its recently announced Drive Constellation simulation software are laying the foundation for a new era of semi-autonomous and autonomous vehicles. And the company's belief that AI will make existing technologies smarter and more efficient has led NVIDIA to develop more powerful graphics processors that are used in AI databases by the biggest names in the tech industry. But perhaps you're not interested in NVIDIA's stock right now, or maybe you already own shares and you're looking for additional companies that are betting on AI and autonomous vehicles. If so, then you should consider what General Motors (NYSE: GM) is doing in the driverless car space and how Amazon.com (NASDAQ: AMZN) is using machine learning to improve nearly every aspect of its business. These companies don't have the same business model as the booming chipmaker, but their commitment to the same tech trends make them great alternatives to NVIDIA. Man sitting at desk looking at smartphone. Image source: Getty Images. Amazon's artificial intelligence is taking over Amazon doesn't make processors to be used for AI-powered servers like NVIDIA does, but the company is implementing AI in its Echo smart speakers, its e-commerce platform, and its Amazon Web Services cloud computing services. Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos has been touting the benefits of machine learning for a while now. One of the most significant ways the company is using this tech is to improve product suggestions on its website and in its app, and to help decide which products online shoppers are more likely to buy. Bezos wrote in a letter to Amazon shareholders last year that \"Machine learning drives our algorithms for demand forecasting, product search ranking, product and deals recommendations, merchandising placements, fraud detection, translations, and much more.\" Story continues Using machine learning to improve nearly every aspect of Amazon's vast e-commerce system is essential: Amazon earned 60% of its total revenue from sales on its U.S. e-commerce site in the most recent quarter. The smarter the company's platform is, the more efficient and valuable it becomes. Of course, Amazon is using AI for more than just its e-commerce sales. The company's Echo speakers, which feature its virtual assistant, Alexa, have become the smart speaker of choice for consumers. This year Amazon is expected to take about 67% of the smart speaker market, outpacing Alphabet 's (NASDAQ: GOOG) (NASDAQ: GOOGL) Google Home's share of 29.5%. The success of the Echo is mainly due to the fact that Amazon has created a virtual assistant that not only answers simple questions and plays music but can also be used to control voice-activated smart-home devices. A recent collaboration between Amazon and Microsoft also allows Alexa to open up Microsoft's Cortana virtual assistant, allowing users to access their calendars easily. Amazon has also integrated Alexa into its mobile app, tablets, Fire TV devices, and growing Echo speaker lineup. That means that Amazon sees the benefit of bringing its AI-based virtual assistant to as many platforms as possible to drive user engagement and spur sales. RBG Capital estimates that Amazon's smart speakers alone could add $10 billion to the company's revenue just two years from now. The last piece of Amazon's AI puzzle is the company's rapidly expanding cloud computing offerings through Amazon Web Services . Amazon holds about 62% of the public cloud computing market right now, and the company is using AI services within AWS to help boost its dominance. Consider that last year Amazon teamed up with Microsoft to take on TensorFlow, Google's machine learning tool for developers. While Amazon can run Google's TensorFlow on its servers, it's trying to offer developers an alternative machine learning tool so that it can tie customers further into its network of technologies. Amazon also offers an array of machine learning services through AWS, including video and image recognition systems, chatbots, text translation, and transcription, as well as platforms developers and data scientists can use to build and train their own machine learning services. Offering the most sophisticated AI tools on AWS is Amazon's way of holding onto its dominance in the cloud computing market and ensuring that it earns the biggest piece of the $411 billion (by 2020) pie it can.

GM is the true leader in driverless cars NVIDIA gets a lot of attention for its autonomous vehicle supercomputer and its potential to help bring fully self-driving vehicles to the road in the next few years. But when it comes to the company's actual sales in the automotive sector, NVIDIA is still just getting started. In the most recent quarter, only 4.5% of the chipmaker's revenue came from its automotive segment. While NVIDIA has mounds of potential in the space, GM has already taken a leadership position. The company bought an AI driverless car company called Cruise Automation back in 2016, and has since integrated the company's tech into some of its vehicles. GM aims to bring a new fully autonomous, all-electric Cruise AV (autonomous vehicle) to the road next year, and has already made significant changes to some of its existing manufacturing plants to mass-produce self-driving cars . GM's recent retooling of existing plants for autonomous vehicle production was a significant step, not just for GM but for the autonomous vehicle industry as a whole. It marked the first time that self-driving cars had been mass-produced on an assembly line. The automaker already has a fleet of about 130 autonomous vehicles that it's currently testing, and its Cruise AV will join the fleet later this year. GM's initial goal with its self-driving pursuits is to benefit from the growing ride-sharing trend. The global ride-sharing market is expected to spike from just $36 billion right now to $285 billion by 2030. The company already has a $500 million stake in Lyft, and its self-driving vehicles could be the perfect addition to ride-hailing companies across the globe. Not only is the 125-year-old automaker poised to benefit from the autonomous ride-hailing market, it could also seize the opportunity to sell self-driving cars directly to consumers. Research from IHS Markit estimates that in 2040 about 36% of all new vehicles sold will be self-driving. That may seem like an impossible figure to comprehend now, but consider how prevalent standard safety features like airbags, ABS, and traction control are now, when once they were add-on features consumers had to pay extra for. In the coming decades , we'll wonder how we ever used to drive around without semi-autonomous and fully autonomous features at the helm. Whether it's through direct consumer sales in the coming decades or through autonomous ride-hailing services, GM is perfectly poised to benefit from either trend. GM CEO Mary Barra summed up the company's future outlook best when she said : \"We've made very important and strategic investments in key technologies that have put us in a leadership position in the areas where this industry is being transformed. In fact, we plan on leading in that transformation.\" Those words are more than just a CEO being confident in her company. GM has already taken the lead in the driverless car space, according to the most recent Navigant Research data. Final thoughts Amazon and GM are vastly different companies than NVIDIA, but both of them offer great alternative plays in the artificial intelligence and autonomous vehicle trends. That doesn't mean that NVIDIA isn't a great company to invest in ( I personally think it's a buy right now ), but investors should always have a few alternative options in mind when considering investing in any market. GM and Amazon are already leading the way in autonomous vehicles and AI, and both companies are taking a long-term approach to the these trends, which should serve them -- and their investors -- well for years to come.

The Canadian markets have also produced a dramatic spike in volume &#x2013; recently setting new all-time highs for the number of bitcoins traded for CAD on Localbitcoins. Also Read:&#xA0;CFTC Subpoenas Leading Exchanges for Trading Data&#xA0; Peruvian P2P Markets Post Record Trade Volume In recent weeks, the Localbitcoins markets of several South American countries have produced record-breaking volume, according to Coin.dance data. The Peruvian P2P markets have produced all-time highs for Localbitcoins trade volume when measuring in both in fiat currency and bitcoin. The last two weeks have comprised the two highest volume weeks in the history of the Peruvian P2P bitcoin markets. During the week of the 26th of May, Peru&#x2019;s Localbitcoins market broke its previous all-time volume high of 80 BTC (dated from December 2015) after producing 106 BTC worth of trade in a single week. The markets then produced 88 BTC worth of trade during the following week of the 2nd of June. When measuring against fiat currency, the week of the 26th of May saw $2.7 million PEN worth of trade (approximately 830,000 USD). Volume Surges Across Latin American P2P Bitcoin Markets Chile&#x2019;s Localbitcoins markets produced a new all-time high for trade volume when paired against fiat currency. The first week of May saw nearly $234.4 million Chilean Pesos (roughly $370,000 USD) worth of BTC exchange hands via Localbitcoins. The Venezuelan Localbitcoins markets have set a new all-time high for the fiat-value of weekly trading activities for the 12th time in 14 weeks. However, the continual establishment of new volume records is a testament to the intensity of Venezuela&#x2019;s hyperinflation, as opposed to being indicative of a sudden significant spike in Venezuelan demand for bitcoin. &#xA0; During the week of the 2nd of June, approximately $6.9 trillion bolivars (roughly $3.75 million USD) worth of trade took place in the P2P markets of Venezuela with, however, 529 BTC worth of trade &#x2013; making it the thirteenth strongest volume in the history of the markets when measuring the total number of bitcoin that changed hands. &#xA0; Canada Sets New P2P Volume Records in Fiat and BTC For the week of the 19th of May, the Canadian Localbitcoins markets suddenly spiked to produce new all-time highs for weekly trade volume when measured against both BTC and fiat-currency.

After an appeal, the court sided with the customs office and barred the import of the mining equipment. Also read: Yahoo! Japan Confirms Entrance Into the Crypto Space Importing Crypto Mining Equipment The Russian city court in Tobolsk has &#8220;banned the import of equipment for the mining of cryptocurrency,&#8221; local media reported last week. Tobolsk is a town in Tyumen Oblast, Russia. The ban, which has already entered into force, applies to a local crypto miner who tried to import mining equipment for his own personal use. According to the website of the Federal Customs Service of Russia, the “resident of the city of Tobolsk purchased server equipment for his own needs from an online store.” The citizen declared: The goods [crypto mining equipment] are intended for personal use, for mathematical and scientific calculations. Trouble with Customs Department According to the customs department, “measures of non-tariff regulation [of the Eurasian Economic Commission] are applied to this commodity [mining equipment].” Non-tariff regulations are trade barriers, restricting imports or exports of goods or services other than tariffs. Picture of the mining equipment posted on the Federal Customs Service of Russia website. The customs office subsequently notified the citizen “of the need to provide additional permits: information about the notification or the conclusion issued by the FSB [Federal Security Service] of Russia.” However, the customs office did not receive these documents so it refused to clear the import. In response, the citizen appealed to the Tobolsk city court, challenging the actions of customs officials. After examining all evidence submitted, the court concluded that “The citizen&#8217;s argument that the extraction of cryptocurrency is only a by-product of his scientific activity was not accepted by the court, since statutory restrictions on imports do not depend on those purposes that are declared by an individual at the time of importation,” the customs office conveyed, adding: The court found lawful the decision of the Tobolsk customs post of the Tyumen customs office to refuse the import of the equipment for cryptocurrency mining.

Exchanges and wallets can easily set up and connect to these new nodes via BTC compatible JSON RPC interfaces. Although technically all the exchanges and wallets can connect to ELA via the non-mining nodes, at the early stage, for security consideration, we will only provide access to limited exchanges. The nodes of these exchanges will be whitelisted and thereby, allowed access to be connected to our mainnet which will allow for the integration of ELA.

The appointed block producer was notified yesterday, I think.\\n\\n&gt;So who is it?\\n\\n&gt;So, we don\\'t know.\\n\\n&gt;Ah, okay. So, but...yeah but someone knows, right?

Um...why is Satoshi secret?\\n\\n&gt;Uh huh...yeah I don\\'t know, security reasons, doesn\\'t want to touch, uh...so you think it\\'s the same?\\n\\n&gt;And now the ABP node is very important. The ABP will be the only one producing blocks on this chain until we reach the 15%, which means that EOS, the EOS chain is validated.\\n\\nPerhaps someone with a greater depth of understanding of this whole process can explain exactly how it will be possible to independently verify that the voting process is legitimate...I\\'m guessing that in voting someone is signing a transaction with their private key, and so later on it should be possible to map every vote transaction onto an EOS account to verify that (1) the vote came from a legit EOS account with tokens, (2) there were no more than 30 votes per token, (3) the voting transaction includes something like a signed message containing which BP the vote was for?\\n\\nThe fact that David Moss and EOSNY were the only ones involved in \"randomly\" selecting this ABP combined with the shroud of secrecy around the identity of the ABP deserves scrutiny IMO, and the excuse that, \"well Satoshi was anonymous\" seems a little flimsy.

That sounds like good news, but here's the thing: There was no reason for Lockheed Martin stock to have sold off in the first place. Actually, the opposite. F-35 Lightning II After an early sell-off, Lockheed stock started fighting its way back. Image source: Getty Images. So what Pundits are attributing Lockheed Martin's stock slide this morning to a general malaise among defense industry investors after last week's dismal performance. Despite reporting generally positive results, shares of not only Lockheed but also Northrop Grumman , General Dynamics , and Raytheon all suffered steep sell-offs last week. Investors found different reasons to dislike each particular stock, but it seems the common theme among them all was a profound distaste for defense stocks -- which is continuing into this week. And yet, the most recent news out of Lockheed Martin was of the positive variety. On Monday, the Department of Defense announced in its daily digest of defense contracts that Lockheed Martin had been awarded a one-year, $1.4 billion logistics contract to service F-35 Lightning II stealth fighter jets that have been sold to the U.S. Air Force, Marine Corps, and Navy, as well as to foreign buyers. Now what This is hardly the stuff of which sell-offs are usually born, which may explain why LockMart stock started clawing back its losses as the day progressed. The fact is, the future for Lockheed Martin looks pretty bright. Free cash flow has been more than healthy over the last 12 months, with cash profits of $4.2 billion running well ahead of reported net income of $2.4 billion. Analysts surveyed by S&P Global Market Intelligence are expecting to see respectable 10% long-term earnings growth from Lockheed over the next five years. The main worry for investors right now is that with a $88.1 billion market cap, Lockheed Martin sells for 21 times even its robust free-cash-flow number -- and most of its strong prospects are already priced into the stock.

The consortium's proposed plan received overwhelming support from creditors, with 95% of voters in favor, during a recent vote earlier this month. The confirmed plan outlines a strategic approach, providing capital, management team, and technology required to establish and operate the new entity as outlined in the bid, which will be implemented pursuant to a Chapter 11 plan.\nThe key provisions included a distribution of liquidcryptocurrencyto account holders, settlements with various groups, and the creation of a new public, regulatory compliant company that will manage Celsius' illiquid assets. The new company will be overseen by a newly appointed Board of Directors.\n\"This has been a lengthy and complicated process for all involved, but we are happy with the result.

Photo: Beata Zawrzel/NurPhoto/Getty (NurPhoto via Getty Images) Bitcoin has sustained its rally well into a second week, and is nearing the $35,000 mark. The rally has lifted tokens at the top of the memecoin market cap, such as dogecoin, shiba inu, and the uniquely-named harry potter obama sonic 10 inu ( HPOS10I ). Bitcoin ( BTC-USD ) has risen by about 22% in the past week, now changing hands at $34,655, (£28,675) according to CoinGecko data . Read more: Crypto live prices As the cryptocurrency market cap has risen by 3% in the past 24 hours to reach $1.32tn, traders appear to be adjusting their strategies to make riskier bets on memecoins. In the past 24 hours, top memecoins such as dogecoin ( DOGE-USD ), shiba inu ( SHIB-USD ), and HPOS10I ( BITCOIN-USD ) have all rallied, up 10%, 11%, and 16% respectively. HPOS10I has made the most impressive gains if we zoom out to the week-long scale, with a rally of 114% in the past seven days. The logo of the HPOS10I memecoin, which is represented by the BITCOIN ticker, was recently featured on an F1 car. This is an example of the growing enthusiasm among memecoin communities that strongly support these tokens. The memecoin sector of the cryptocurrency space has been swept into rising action by the steady march of bitcoin over the last two weeks. Traders anticipate the world's largest digital asset by market capitalisation will soon have its own spot bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF). A spot bitcoin ETF is a financial product that investors hope will open the gateway for mainstream capital to flood the crypto market. Why does the crypto sector need a spot bitcoin ETF? Several key factors highlight the importance of a spot bitcoin ETF and its potential impact on the cryptocurrency market: Regulatory Oversight: An ETF would be under US regulatory jurisdiction, lending it credibility. Retail Accessibility: ETFs are more accessible to the general public, opening the door to more widespread bitcoin investment. Investor Protection: The US Securities Exchange Commission’s (SEC) role in ensuring that the financial product meets rigorous standards would enhance the appeal of an ETF. Institutional Adoption: With the potential for significant investments from pension and mutual funds, an approved spot bitcoin ETF could funnel billions into the crypto market. Story continues According to a report, the approval of a bitcoin spot ETF may generate $600bn in new demand for the digital asset. According to Cointelegraph, CryptoQuant analysts believe that an ETF approval will lead to a $1tn increase in bitcoin’s market capitalisation. The current market capitalisation of bitcoin is $675bn, according to CoinGecko.

Digital subscriptions are increasingly common as more people get content from various subscription channels, unlike the past few decades where cable TV was the default source. Accordingly, the need to support crypto payment for Netflix and other subscription services is on the rise, even timely.\nRevuto is a subscription management platform on Cardano that aims to add efficiency and control to the payment of subscriptions. They are nowjoining hands with Genius Yield, an equally innovative order-book DEX launching on Cardano to fast-track the adoption of DeFi services. While both protocols would support each other’s ecosystem, a standout benefit would be paying for Netflix, Apple TV, Amazon, DSTV, and other subscription services using Genius Yield’s GENS and other Cardano tokens. It is a vital support allowing users to take control of their spending, save money, while also earning cashback in Revuto’s REVU tokens. Meanwhile, it will be possible for users to earn GENS by staking REVU via the ISPO in the Revuto Staking Center.\nStreaming services can be annoying with their subscription models for all their quality content. You have probably heard a friend or relative furious over the billing policies of one of their subscriptions. The problems range from difficulties in cancellation, automatic renewal, and other communication-related issues.\nA Blockchain-Based Subscription Service\nThe fundamental issue with most subscriptions is that they rely on credit cards or bank payments. Once you sign up and agree to terms that most people never read, the subscription service can automatically deduct from your bank account.\nRevuto introduces the concept of a virtual debit card to grant users more control over subscription payments, allowing users to pay with Cardano and its tokens. The idea is to have a decentralized application that users can utilize to manage their subscriptions. This virtual debit card is operationalized as a decentralized application (dApp) that runs on the Cardano blockchain.\nHere is a summary of how the subscription management app will work:\n• Download the Revuto app and set up an account, a straightforward process;\n• Add subscriptions you intend to manage. They could range from music streaming services like Netflix, software packages, and more.\n• Once the subscriptions are linked, you can begin paying using GENS and other supported tokens.\nThe real prize is your ability to block, snooze, and generally control payments to your subscription service. This versatility allows the account holder to prevent unwanted subscription charges that make subscriptions more expensive than what you signed up for. Besides, you don’t have to cancel the subscription when you want to snooze payments for a while before resuming.\nThe Cardano Blockchain Provides Base Support\nRevuto achieves its high performance because it launches from a robust layer, built from the ground up with the intention of being inherently scalable. The Cardano crypto blockchain is the handiwork of Ethereum co-founder Charles Hoskinson and a team of developers who sought to create a high-functionality and research-based network.\nAccordingly, Cardano is an excellent host for decentralized systems and applications. The rise of Decentralized Finance (DeFi) bodes well for this bespoke blockchain and its native coin, ADA. The protocol has significantly higher throughput than Ethereum, implementing a unique architecture with different settlement and computation layers. Accordingly, smart contract execution does not clash with transactions, as is the case for Ethereum.\nUsing Cardano blockchain, this utility has allowed an integrated decentralized hub like Genius Yield, SundaeSwap, and others to thrive. Its efficiency and increasing stature in the DeFi sector fit well with services that offer a secure and fast settlement.\nMore Than Just Subscriptions Management\nMeanwhile, with Revuto in the picture, users can make payments efficiently and leverage recurring payments with REVU and get extra services for money management. Revuto received three million early sign-ups for dApp, with hundreds of thousands of users worldwide. These numbers bode well for an upcoming Fintech startup earning Revuto accolades like the award for the fastest-growing consumer product at the recent World Blockchain Summit in Dubai.\nThe ability to pay for your subscriptions in Cardano tokens is revolutionary. Bitcoin has struggled to gain traction as a medium of exchange for all its popularity. This utility application provides a real-world use for cryptocurrency.\nRevuto is looking to make its app a wholesome product. Soon, users will be able to exchange fiat and crypto in real-time and other decentralized finance services like lending and borrowing. Overall, the subscriptions management platform will provide a mobile-friendly and excellent decentralized finance management tool. The decision to launch on the Cardano blockchain is a testament to this vision. Revuto has a native Cardano mobile and non-custodial wallets with plans to add their custodial wallet to augment user experience.\nForecasting Growth in The Subscriptions Sector\nThe world is trending online by the year. This trend is likely to manifest in the subscriptions and billing management sector, with the global marketestimatedto grow from about $3.9 billion today to $7.4 billion in 2027. The accelerated growth of digital streaming services is the biggest growth driver. it is the golden age for streaming with more potential in developing markets\nThere is excellent potential for a subscriptions management tool with such a market size. There will be tens, even hundreds of millions more people joining this demographic in the next few years. Accordingly, Revuto is entering the scene strategically for all stakeholders.\nLooking Forward\nCryptocurrency and the blockchain launched on the fundamental premise that consumers need more control of their finances. This idea is relevant in countless fields. Subscriptions fall in this category because some services are downright abusive in their billing policies.Genius YieldandRevutotake the tenets of decentralization and user empowerment in these industries and seek to transform how consumers relate to subscription services. There is a great need for such services. By forming a fitting coalition, Genius Yield and Revuto will likely reap from the appreciation users will have for such convenience.\nCONTACT: Company Name : Genius Yield Email Id : hello (at) geniusyield.co Company Website : https://www.geniusyield.co/ || Genius Yield HÜNENBERG, SWITZERLAND, March 18, 2022 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Subscriptions are an integral part of modern life.

Now, it’s time to talk about how to lose them all.', 'Let’s say you want to lose your Bitcoin (BTC) totally, irretrievably and forever. Hey, it’s not our place to wonder why. Maybe it’s part of some elaborate performance art piece, like the guy who destroyed all his possessions or perhaps you’ve always been big fans of electronic music outfit The KLF, who famously burned 1 million pounds on a remote Scottish island. Or, your reason might be more mundane and you simply don’t want your soon-to-be-divorced spouse to get their share of the investment you both know you own.Whatever your reason, we’re not here to judge. And, while we’re usually in the business of helping people protect their coins, it’s easy enough to reverse engineer security to help you lose them in the fastest and easiest way possible.Brag about your BitcoinIf you’ve got it and wish to lose it, flaunt it. Want to get rid of that Rolex weighing down your wrist? Pair it with a t-shirt, flash it about in a crowded bar and then take a walk through a bad part of town after dark — you’ll soon find yourself relieved of your timepiece.It’s the same with Bitcoin. You want the world to know you’re a Bitcoiner and, ideally, that you’ve stacked enough sats for it to be worthwhile stealing them. So, tell them. Add laser eyes to your social media profiles, keep tweeting those diamond hands and don’t forget about the offline world either. Be sure to boast about your mastery of Bitcoin to all your friends, family and, most importantly, new acquaintances. You never know who will be tempted to start probing your defenses in order to relieve you of your investment.Keep it on-exchangeIn the early Wild West days of Bitcoin, losing your coin was child’s play, as there was no shortage of disreputable exchanges that would help you lose your investment. If you kept your coins in a hosted wallet, it was only a matter of time before the exchange went bust like Mt. Gox, got hacked, lost coins by engaging in fractional reserve banking or the owners absconded (or died) with your keys.The exchange market has matured significantly in recent years, with enhanced security measures such as two-factor authentication and even published proof-of-reserves and proof-of-custody. Don’t be disheartened: As long as you entrust your keys to a third party, anything could happen — and probably will.Exchanges still go bust with reassuring regularity. Even more encouragingly, governments are now actively targeting Bitcoiners’ wealth. And, not just traditional authoritarians like China and Russia, the Canadian government recently instructed financial institutions — including cryptocurrency custodians — to freeze the accounts of anyone who donates even a small amount to the “trucker protests.”Deputy PM Chrystia Freeland: \"The names of both individuals and entities as well as crypto wallets have been shared by the RCMP with financial institutions and accounts have been frozen and more accounts will be frozen.\" pic.twitter.com/iA69DbRJl1— True North (@TrueNorthCentre) February 17, 2022Even if you have a strong password and 2FA protecting your exchange account, you never know what other vulnerability might be exploited to gain access and drain it. If you’ve got your coins on-exchange, relax: They’re in unsafe hands.Write it downThings get a little trickier if you’ve decided to self-custody your Bitcoin offline in a secure hardware wallet. Or do they? After all, when you hold the keys yourself, the power to lose your coins is completely in your hands. Why wait for an exchange to go bust when you can start adopting security “worst practice” today?The secret to making your wallet insecure lies in your seed phrase, the string of words you use to generate your private key. The simplest way to lose your coins is to memorize your seed phrase and then delete or destroy any record of it. A few months on, hardly anyone has a hope of recalling every word in the correct order.But, what if you’re cursed with an eidetic memory? Easy: Write it down. Even better, do it twice in physical pen-and-paper form, ideally kept near your hardware wallet. And, for good measure, record it in a cloud-based document where anyone with a will can access it through a brute-force attack. This is particularly effective if you regularly remind people you hold wealth in Bitcoin.Disinherit the next generationThis one is for those who like playing the long game. You know the phrase “you can’t take it with you?” Well, with Bitcoin, you can. If you haven’t considered inheritance planning, then your entire investment will likely go to the grave with you, joining the estimated 3.7 million BTC (around 18% of the coins there will ever be) that has already been lost forever.Of course, this requires you to reverse the principles above: If you really want to cheat your children out of their inheritance, you need to make it as difficult for them to gain access to your keys as any attacker. So, if that’s the way you want to go, don’t tell your heirs, don’t write down your seed phrase, and do get a hardware wallet. Even better, cut your 24-word seed phrase into many pieces and store them in many hidden holes around the world with no recovery instructions whatsoever. Your heirs won’t thank you at all.Whatever you do, just make sure your Bitcoin storage and security providers don’t have a specific and robust protocol for inheritance planning. You can rest easy in the knowledge that not even the Devil himself will get your wealth when you pass on.If, for some reason, you do want to protect your Bitcoin, just ignore everything I’ve written. Even better, do the opposite. But, all you’d be doing is securing your investment in the only censorship-resistant and inflation-proof store of value ever invented. And, why would you want to go and do something as dull as that?This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

The ACCC explained that the ads &#8220;promoted investment in cryptocurrency or money-making schemes.&#8221; They featured well-known people, such as &#8220;businessman Dick Smith, TV presenter David Koch and former NSW Premier Mike Baird,&#8221; the ACCC noted, adding that Facebook users were led to believe these scams were genuinely associated with these celebrities. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); ACCC Chair Rod Sims said: The essence of our case is that Meta is responsible for these ads that it publishes on its platform.

Paul is an American author, physician, and retired politician. The former representative from Texas launched The Ron Paul Liberty Report in 2015 to bring &#x201C;provocative opinion and analysis to the breaking issues affecting our lives and finances,&#x201D; its website details. The former congressman has repeatedly warned that the government could crack down on bitcoin. &#x201C;My concern is that governments over centuries have been notoriously very eager to have control of the money. Believe me, they will not give up control of money,&#x201D; he described. However, interest in bitcoin has soared recently with more institutional investors supporting the ecosystem. This week, the Ukrainian government created a legal framework for cryptocurrency following the invasion by Russia. It also set up an official crypto donation website. Moreover, BTC is currently legal tender in El Salvador. Paul was asked if he still believes that bitcoin is at risk of being outright banned or outlawed. He replied: Yeah, I do, mainly because I&#x2019;m influenced a whole lot by history, and the gold history, and my interest in studying money and some of the principles that Austrian economics teaches about what the nature of money should be. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Nonetheless, Paul emphasized: But that doesn&#x2019;t sway me from arguing the case for those who know about crypto, who understand it better than I do, that it should be obviously permitted. But a lot of people don&#x2019;t understand it so I would be cautious. He further shared: &#x201C;I&#x2019;ve been trying to figure out, is [bitcoin] more like a stock or a bond or a hard asset commodity. Right now, I would say, looking at different statistics, it seems to trace stock prices.&#x201D; In June last year, the former congressman said he wants bitcoin to be totally legalized to compete with the U.S. dollar and let the people decide. &#x201C;My goal is to legalize the competition and the people will sort it out.

Lawsuit Claims Coinbase Sold 79 Unregistered Crypto Securities to Customers A class-action lawsuit was filed last week against Coinbase Global Inc., Coinbase Inc., and CEO Brian Armstrong. Lead plaintiffs and Coinbase users Christopher Underwood, Louis Oberlander, and Henry Rodriguez allege that from Oct. 8, 2019, to the present, Coinbase let customers buy and sell 79 different cryptocurrencies without disclosing that they are in fact securities. The plaintiffs added that these crypto securities are not registered with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) or any state regulators, and Coinbase is not registered as a securities exchange or a broker-dealer. The plaintiffs claim that &#x201C;Coinbase&#x2019;s sale of these tokens violates both federal and state law.&#x201D; The class covers all persons or entities who transacted any of the 79 crypto tokens on Coinbase or the Coinbase Pro platform during the class period.

The SEC chief said on several occasions that there is not enough investor protection in the crypto sector. He also stressed that some platforms list 50 to 100 tokens, some of which are likely to be securities. However, the SEC has not been actively clarifying which cryptocurrencies it considers securities.

People could earn cash by uploading video evidence of themselves destroying physical copies of the card.\\n\\nNo rationale was ever provided, but “Séance Guy” was true to their word. They paid out $1200 in Bitcoin ($0.50 per copy destroyed, plus $10 flat for the video), and offered helpful guidance such as “Magic: The Gathering cards do not burn well and kinda stink when burned. Use a fire pit or fireplace for the most convenience for you, but it is possible to slowly burn each one with only a common lighter” ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/Jobs4Bitcoins/comments/32a2w3/hiring_anyone_to_purchase_and_destroy_magic_the/)).\\n\\nAs the months went by, the requests escalated. Content creators like u/SaffronOlive reported being contacted by \"Séance Guy\" with offers to write paid articles about the card ([source](https://twitter.com/SaffronOlive/status/675707186690002945?s=20&amp;t=a4FQ8o16PToYe77MuUp7CQ)). Why Séance, you ask? To this day, no one knows. Speculation was rampant, but no explanation was offered beyond the desire to conduct an experiment ([source](https://twitter.com/TristanGregson/status/587055989364371456?s=20&amp;t=F2FpeXfI4-B5OzFDJ_CXww)).\\n\\nEight months later, “Séance Guy” returned with the most outlandish request of all. A bounty of 90.5 Bitcoin was offered to any Pro Tour competitor who managed to pilot a Séance deck to Top 8 in the Modern Pro Tour ([source](https://www.reddit.com/r/magicTCG/comments/3w2iko/the_guy_who_paid_people_to_destroy_s%C3%A9ances_is_now/)). In 2017, this represented a $38,000 payout. Today, those 90.5 BTC would be worth more than $3.5 million dollars.\\n\\nNo one took them up on the offer.\\n\\nWhat happened next is less well known, but no less interesting. “Séance Guy”, it was revealed in an anonymous Q&amp;A on the Kitchen Table Magic podcast, had even gone so far as to hire a think tank of Magic pros to research the best possible Séance deck and report their findings. They had also received threats from players for “disrespecting” the Modern PT, and numerous fake videos in which piles of bulk with a few Séance on top were destroyed hoping for easy payouts ([source](https://kitchentablemagic.org/2017/10/31/seance-halloween-special/#more-552)).\\xa0\\n\\nThe kicker in all of this? Séance, as a Magic card, is actually extremely powerful. Though it has become a meme, the enchantment has always been right on the cusp of Modern playability, a finding confirmed by the think tank all those years ago. And the tools to build a great Séance deck have only gotten better over the years. In particular, the cycle of evoke elementals from *Modern Horizons 2* are exactly the kind of power boost that Séance has needed.\\n\\nToday, we channel the spirit of u/jobs141910 and attempt to bring Séance back from the dead. We’ve got four new decklists to test: a classic Abzan Siege Rhino strategy, a more fashionable MH2 Reanimator pile with Wandering Mind, a Yorion version of the Abzan deck, and a Mardu Ephemerate shell with Fulminator Mage and Ranger-Captain of Eos.\\n\\nHas the time come to finally write the next next chapter of the Séance saga? Will our efforts yield battlefield glory and get that elusive 5-0? Or will we inadvertently summon the ghost of “Séance Guy” and pull them back into the fray? There is only one way to find out!\\n\\nHappy brewing,\\n\\n\\\\--cavedan\\n\\n\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\\\*\\n\\nFaithless Brewing is a Magic: the Gathering podcast for the spike rogue.

This is below the five-year average of 8.6%, and the 10-year average of 6.4%.\n\"As a result, the earnings decline for the fourth quarter is larger today compared to the end of last week and compared to the end of the quarter,\" FactSet's senior earnings analyst John Butterswrote in a Friday market update. \"If the index reports an actual decline in earnings for Q4 2022, it will mark the first year-over-year decline in earnings reported by the index since Q3 2020.”\nSpeaking late last week on CoinDesk TV, David Siemer, CEO of accounting software provider Wave Financial, said that the market is giving mixed signals – strong job numbers, but mediocre earnings results – and he still expects a recession this year, albeit a weak one.\n“I am a little more optimistic that it won't be quite as severe a recession as in a great recession or major, major recession,” he said, pointing to the resilience of consumers. “The fact that the Fed's actions are having such a slow effect doesn't mean cumulatively they won't eventually have a major effect. We're probably still a quarter or two away from seeing what the Fed's actions have really actually done to the economy.”\nAnd what does this mean to crypto prices, looking forward? Joe DiPasquale, CEO of crypto fund manager BiBull Capital, wrote in a note to CoinDesk that crypto markets are “optimistic” after a modest rate increase and bitcoin will “oscillate around the $20K support level for the next few months, barring other unforeseen events and market action.”\nMeanwhile, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) is opening the Asia trading week at 103.12, staying in what many analysts call a “defensive” position. The measure of the world’s largest fiat asset spent most of last year surging, hitting stock and crypto prices hard.

Venture capitalists enjoyed the ride on the way up, but certainly felt the pain on the way down in 2022 as cascading failures knocked the wind out of their portfolios.\nFor the industry, the trillion-dollar question will be: Did VCs learn anything, and can they avoid repeating the mistakes of last year that severely dented their profits.

But when it comes to the travel sector, I think its crystal clear that the space is continuing to boom. Therefore, I really think that its hard for investors to go wrong by buying travel stocks at this point. Delta (NYSE: DAL ) on Dec. 14 increased its fourth-quarter guidance in one very bullish sign for the travel sector. Moreover, its CEO, Ed Bastian, said, Demand for air travel remains robust as we exit the year, and Deltas momentum is building. Since, based on Bastians statement, its clear that the demand for air travel remains strong and appears to be accelerating, most American travel companies are going to be very successful for at least the medium term. InvestorPlace - Stock Market News, Stock Advice & Trading Tips Also worth noting is an optimistic statement in August by the CEO of CWT , a company that coordinates business travel. Demand for business travel and meetings is back with a vengeance, of that there is absolutely no doubt, said Patrick Andersen, the CEO. And providing a succinct, witty endorsement of travel stocks earlier this month was CNBCs Jim Cramer, who said , The biggest theme is the rise of this life is too short mentality. People dont want to waste their time anymore. Ticker Company Price H Hyatt $111.82 BKNG Booking Holdings $2,402.34 MGM MGM $40.28 MTN Vail Resorts $254.26 AAL American Airlines $16.02 UBER Uber Technologies $29.93 EADSY Airbus $32.81 Hyatt ( H ) Hyatt Hotels (H) building with logo in front of shrubbery Source: EQRoy/Shutterstock.com Morgan Stanley, whose outlook on American stocks tends to be quite bearish, is nonetheless very upbeat on Hyatt (NYSE: H ).

Meanwhile, Hyatts occupancy levels and prices have been climbing, Morgan Stanley reported. Story continues Partially driven by higher fees and capital returns to shareholders, Hyatts free cash flow per share and valuation will meaningfully increase, MS predicted last month. Moreover, Morgan Stanley expects the hotel operators 2023 EBITDA will come in around $1.3 billion. Finally, MS noted that the company intends to increase its total number of rooms by 5%. over the next two years. Hyatt tends to cater to wealthier individuals, the vast majority of whom, in my opinion, have not been badly hurt by high inflation and rising interest rates. The shares have momentum, as they jumped 23% in the month that ended on Jan. 23. Booking Holdings (BKNG) a person opens up Booking.com on a smartphone Source: Denys Prykhodov / Shutterstock.com One of the worlds largest online travel agencies, Booking Holdings (NASDAQ: BKNG ), like Hyatt, has a great deal of positive momentum, as its shares climbed 20% in the month that ended on Jan. 23. Since it serves countries all over the world , BKNG can meaningfully benefit from Chinas reopening and the acceleration of economic growth thats currently occurring in Europe. In the U.S., BKNG has a 38% share of the online hotel booking market, leaving the company well-positioned to benefit from the strong rebound of business travel in America. On Dec. 29, investment bank Tigress Financial issued a bullish note on BKNG stock. According to the firm, the demand for travel will stay robust, and it thinks that the shares will get a massive lift from Chinas reopening. Tigress maintained a $3,210 price target and a strong-buy rating on the shares. BKNG has an attractive five-year forward PEG ratio of 0.54. MGM (MGM) A photo of the MGM logo on the MGM casino building. Source: Michael Neil Thomas / Shutterstock.com Ive long been bullish on MGMs (NYSE: MGM ) shares, which Ive also owned for many months. As reasons for my optimism on the name, Ive cited MGMs substantial leverage to Las Vegas powerful recovery, the excellent track record of Barry Diller, who has invested a great deal of money in the company, and the casino owners ability to benefit from the growth of sports betting through its joint venture, BetMGM. Financial research firm Hedgeye recently issued a bullish note on MGM, stating, We are becoming more positive on the LV Strip, The firm expects Vegas casinos to get a big lift from the return of business conferences to the city and the high number of consumers who are currently visiting the area. Also upbeat on MGM stock earlier this month was investment bank Stifel, which upgraded the shares to buy from hold. The firm predicts that the company will benefit from its robust database and its powerful loyalty program, as well as Las Vegas resurgence and the rejuvenation of the Chinese gambling center of Macau. Meanwhile, New York is looking to allow three casinos to open in the New York City area, and there are rumors that Texas, where I currently live, is going to legalize gambling soon. MGM could get a major foothold in the two markets, both of which are huge. Vail Resorts (MTN) A concept token for Medicalchain (MTN) on euros. Source: Shutterstock In a December column, I wrote that Vail Resorts (NYSE: MTN ) should benefit from its focus on middle class and wealthy consumers, along with generally strong..demand for skiing. That prediction appears to have been correct, as the company, on Jan. 18, reported that the number of visits to its North American destination mountain resorts and regional ski areas had increased 12.5% during the current skiing season versus the same period a year earlier. Moreover, its ski school revenue,  its dining revenue, and its retail/rental revenue soared 35.6%, 58%, and 34.4%, respectively, year-over-year. Thus, it is among the best travel stocks to buy. Although the company said that Season-to-date destination guest visitation at [its] western U.S. resorts was below [its] expectations because of extreme weather that led to flight cancellations, I believe that the increases in the companys metrics were still very impressive. Moreover, the firm reported that a portion of those who had to cancel their visits to its resorts earlier this season would return later in the year. In the three months that ended on Jan. 23, MTN has climbed 16%, showing that it has positive momentum, and the shares have an attractive Enterprise Value/EBITDA ratio of 14. American Airlines ( AAL ) An American Airlines (AAL) airplane waiting on the tarmac. Represents airline stocks. Source: GagliardiPhotography / Shutterstock.com American Airlines (NASDAQ: AAL ) is benefiting from the boom of the airline sector described by Deltas CEO, whom I quoted in the introduction to this column. Earlier this month, AAL stated that its fourth-quarter revenue had jumped 16%-17% versus 2019 levels, up from its previous estimate of an 11%-13% gain. Even more impressively, the airline now expects its Q4 EPS to come in at $1.12-$1.17, versus its previous outlook of 50 cents to 70 cents and analysts previous average estimate of 58 cents. Meanwhile, American is well-positioned to take market share from Southwest (NYSE: LUV ) after the latter airlines recent debacle. Airlines have generally been performing very well recently, as, reporting data from Bank of America, Seeking Alpha reported that System net sales were up 14.6% above the pre-pandemic 2019 level for the week ending January 8 to continue the recent positive trends seen throughout the holiday periods. AAL stock has an attractive forward price-earnings ratio of 7.4. Thus, it is among the top travel stocks to buy. Uber Technologies ( UBER ) The Uber logo is displayed on a smartphone on top of a map background. Source: Proxima Studio / Shutterstock.com Given its strong leverage to the number of people flying and tourism, Uber (NYSE: UBER ) is well-positioned to benefit from the travel stocks boom in general and the current flying surge in particular. Additionally, the company, with its Uber Eats unit, is exploiting the food delivery trend, whose popularity has been surging in recent years. Indeed, analysts, on average, expect its sales to jump 16% this year to $36.85 billion, and their mean estimate calls for its per-share loss to narrow to just 25 cents this year from $4.87 in 2022. Their average price target on the name is $45.92, more than 50% above the stocks current level. Meanwhile, Goldman Sachs believes that Uber can exploit increased demand for the delivery of goods beyond food. And Uber is finally starting to dip its toe into the autonomous-driving pool, as the company has started to offer autonomous rides in Las Vegas and is poised to extend the service to Los Angeles. Of course, using autonomous vehicles rather than human drivers should save Uber a great deal of money, particularly as the companys use of self-driving cars expands around the U.S. and beyond. Trading at a price-sales ratio of just two, Ubers valuation is very attractive at this point. Airbus (EADSY) Like travel stocks such as Uber, Airbus (OTCMKTS: EADSY ), a huge Europe-based plane maker, is well-positioned to benefit from the airlines prosperity. In fact, Airbus, unlike its main competitor, Boeing (NYSE: BA ) (which has been beset by huge execution problems and was deep in the red for the 12 months that ended in September), is already very prosperous and profitable. In the 12 months that ended in September, Airbus net income came in at a staggering 4.15 billion euros. Moreover, in 2022, the European plane maker delivered 661 planes and received orders for 1,078 planes, while Boeing delivered 479 jets and received orders for 774., TipRanks noted. And indicating that the overall demand for planes was quite strong in the fourth quarter, General Electric (NYSE: GE ) reported today that the orders of its Aerospace unit, which makes plane engines, had surged 20% last quarter versus the s...\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":72,\"stop_loss\":22312.57,\"take_profit\":23598.76,\"forecast_10d\":[23264.29, 22939.40, 21819.04, 21651.18, 21870.88, 21788.20, 21808.10, 22220.80, 24307.84, 23623.47]}"}

This indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options side by side.It will turn negative when the put options premium is higher than similar-risk call options.

Over the past three months, there hasn\\'t been a single occurrence of a 10% or higher 30-day skew, which is usually considered a bearish event.This data is very encouraging, considering that Bitcoin saw a 24% correction on Jan. 11, in addition to a 19% sell-off 10 days later. Yet, there is no evidence that options traders demanded more significant premiums for downside protection.Futures premium held excessive-optimistic levelsBy measuring the expense gap between futures and the regular spot market, a trader can gauge the level of bullishness in the market.The three-month futures usually trade with a 6% to 20% annualized premium (basis) versus regular spot exchanges. Whenever this indicator fades or turns negative, this is an alarming red flag. This situation is known as \"backwardation\" and indicates that the market is turning bearish.On the other hand, a sustainable basis above 20% signals excessive leverage from buyers, creating the potential for massive liquidations and eventual market crashes.March 2021 BTC futures premium.

Even during its darkest periods, the futures premium held above 10% annualized rate, indicating optimism from professional traders.Meanwhile, the current 5.5% level, equivalent to a 50% annualized rate, indicates excessive buyers\\' leverage. Perpetual futures (inverse swaps) could be the root of this issue, and retail traders more widely use those contracts.Weekly BTC perpetual futures funding rate. Source: NYDIG Digital Assets DataTake notice as the funding rate has exceeded 2.5% per week, thus more than compensating the 50% annualized premium of the March contracts.Therefore, arbitrage desks and market makers are likely happy to pay such a hefty premium on fixed-month contracts while simultaneously shorting the perpetual future and profit from the rate difference.To conclude, this movement perfectly explains why options markets are relatively neutral while futures markets show excessive buyers\\' leverage.

Interestingly, at the beginning of her speech, De La Cueva mentioned that the cryptocurrency&#x2019;s technology is based on blockchain. However, she later pointed out that there is no standard &#x201C;clarity&#x201D; on the nature of bitcoin. The Secretary repeated the same rhetoric of Spanish state entities on crypto assets, saying that the industry lacks a standardized regulatory framework. She even mentioned that one of the negative sides of BTC is that it &#x201C;cannot be supervised or sanctioned.&#x201D; De La Cueva added: At the moment, the use [of bitcoin] is very limited, but the European Central Bank already warns that a generalization could trigger unwanted effects on the functioning of the monetary system. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Replicating the Bank of Spain and CNMV Rhetoric The same statement was used by both the Bank of Spain and the National Securities Market Commission (CNMV) in a recently issued document. Both entities warned on how crypto assets could harm the stability of the traditional monetary system. The efforts of the Spanish government to tax crypto holdings have been evident in the last few months. As news.Bitcoin.com reported, the government recently approved a bill that requires cryptocurrency owners to disclose their crypto holdings and any gains on their assets. The measure is part of the tax authorities&#x2019; efforts to remind crypto owners of their tax obligations. Still, Spain&#x2019;s tough stance against crypto assets made the headlines in 2018. The Bank of Spain, jointly with the CNMV, issued its first warning on risks that carry cryptos and initial coin offerings (ICOs).

Polkadot Roadmap Outlines Layer 0 Deployment Initiatives Polkadot released a roadmap highlighting that it is currently in its Rococo phase, the first of three major phases until the network goes live. Here is a breakdown of the roadmap. Rococo Testnet Rollout Polkadot (DOT) plans to continue with its launch of parachains, also referred to as application-specific data structures. These parachains, just like with parathreads, are what will allow Polkadot to pair with other more established networks, such as Ethereum and Bitcoin, through a mechanism called Cross-Chain Message Passing-lite. Polkadot is still in the Rococo phase of testing its parachains. Once the code is evaluated and approved, we can expect to see Polkadot submit its vote via onchain governance to power the parachains and slot auctions on Kusama. Kusama Rollout The scalable multi-chain network, Kusama, is what Polkadot says will serve as an “additional proving ground” for parachains. It’s effectively a sandbox designed to support further testing and network effects before launching on Polkadot. Its looser parameters allow developers to test new ideas while also helping gain visibility amongst community members. Enabling parachain functionality will ultimately fall down to a vote by Kusama governance. Should the rollout be approved, non-permissioned candle auctions will be used to allocate 100 parachain slot leases. Polkadot emphasizes that users can expect a new auction “roughly every two weeks,” with more set to come available as each lease expires. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Polkadot Slot Bidding The slot bidding involved in parachain offerings plays a significant role. Rather than using the initial coin offering (ICO) model, which can be (and was) easily exploited due to the limited terms of proof needed, its parachain offerings incorporate candle auctions alongside a heavy focus on governance. But these aren’t traditional candle auctions. Rather than taking the typical route of using a random number to determine the duration of its opening phase in bids, Polkadot’s will be retroactively determined, meaning that the bids that have been placed earliest stand the highest probability of success. Once an auction has ended, Polkadot will deploy the winning parachain to the network at the beginning of its lease period. Parachain slots can be leased in six-month increments for a maximum of two years, after which they’ll go back up for auction. Although difficult to estimate the costs of running these parachains, given the price, is “purely a function of market supply and demand,” as Polkadot is aiming for a safer and more secure way of bidding with its parachain auctions. Next Steps Once auctions have ended and these parachains are live, Polkadot says the network’s launch will be fully complete. While it’s possible to see future upgrades to the network, this scalability will ultimately be in the hands of its community.

Despite the uncertainties that cryptos have, current crypto market performances create enough confidence to rethink the current business model, said the expert.

Experts predict that several of these theories will enjoy unusually long lifespans into the new year. They also believe that growing amplification of conspiracy theories by partisan media outlets, social media algorithms, and politicians will continue.\n“We’re moving to a new era of alternative facts,” said Yotam Ophir, assistant professor at the University of Buffalo who studies misinformation. “There is a sense that we can’t trust anyone anymore and that any argument is as good as the next.”\n2020 was a milestone year for conspiracy theories for three reasons, according to experts. Extreme partisanship in the U.S. turned several nonpolitical events into political flashpoints. Partisan news sources and politicians as senior as President Trump became more willing to amplify misinformation as long as it aligns with their politics. And algorithm-driven social media destinations deepened their penchant to become echo chambers for like-minded people to confirm their biases, evolving into strategic tools for politicians and conspiracy theorists to rapidly spread misinformation and influence the populace.\nAll of these elements came together during a year burdened by global uncertainty and social anxiety—environments in which conspiracies thrive, Ophir said. What’s more, the real-world harm that could result from conspiracy theories tends to hit underrepresented communities harder, said Nicol Turner-Lee, the director of the Center for Technology Innovation at the Brookings Institution.\n“They suppress some voices in communities where [the consequences] really matter,” she said. “Some of the things that were put out were emboldened by our political climate and racial division.”\nExperts say several changes must be made to combat the rapid rise of conspiracy theories. There needs to be a public educational effort to help people discern real news from fake news. Social media companies have to do a better job at fighting misinformation and conspiracy theories. And the general public must genuinely question what they see and read, rather than merely seek to confirm what they hope is true. Until that happens, conspiracy theories will proliferate unabated.\nWithout further ado, here are three of 2020’s biggest conspiracy theories:\nAfter a new strand ofCOVID led to a pandemicin 2020, conspiracy theories emerged about everything from thevirus’ originto thelatest vaccinesand treatments.\nConspiracy theorists suggested thatthe new 5G wireless broadband standard may have caused or spread the coronavirus, leading arsonists in the U.K. to set 5G towers on fire. Some conspiracists suggested the coronavirus was created in Chinese lab as an attempt to create a bioweapon against enemies. Another conspiracy promulgated in China suggested that U.S. military members visiting Wuhan brought the virus to China. EvenMicrosoftco-founder Bill Gates couldn’t escape conspiracist scrutiny: one theory suggested the billionaire, who has spent much of his post-Microsoft life investing in health initiatives in underserved areas of the globe, was responsible for creating the virus in order to profit off a vaccine.\nFor a while, many Americans bought into the mistaken idea that the coronavirus was a politically motivated hoax meant to take down President Trump—or that it was a virus akin to influenza and therefore not a big deal (even though “big deal” is relative—the flu kills anywhere from 10,000 to 60,000 people each year). Both of these suggestions were amplified by conservative politicians, including President Trump.\nAs for treatment and prevention, conspiracy theorists suggested that masks would somehow awaken a dormant coronavirus living inside people’s bodies. (Uh, no.) Others suggested thatdrinking or injecting bleachwould cure the disease. (An extremely dangerous proposition, according to every poison control center in the nation.) The most recent theories argue that the vaccine (which measures about 125 nanometers) contains a microchip to allow the government to monitor Americans, that the drug (which uses mRNA to provoke an immune response) will alter people’s DNA, or that people’s immune systems are far better than any vaccine.\nAlmost 2 million people worldwide have died from COVID-19 to date.\nOver time, experts predict many of theories will slowly fade, but some fear that the latest conspiracy theories about the coronavirus vaccine will lead to strengthening the antivaxxer movement.\n“COVID will come and go,” Ophir said. “But what about all the other vaccines? Will there be a spillage to the HPV vaccine? To the flu vaccine?”\nQAnon, a disproven conspiracy theory involving an alleged global child sex-trafficking ring,used to be associated with the far-fringy right. In 2020, though, it gained new life—as well as two mouthpieces in a newly elected U.S. Congress who could amplify the message further.\nSome QAnon theories describe President Trump as a savior figure elected to end these nefarious activities—all of which have been perpetrated by the left, naturally—and bring alleged members to justice. (Who, might you ask? Oprah Winfrey, Tom Hanks, Hillary and Bill Clinton, and a raft of other high-profile, big-ticket Democratic donors.)\nThe conspiracy theory should have died when it first emerged in 2016—naturally, the year Trump was elected U.S. president—but 2020 saw politicians and churchgoers alike revive parts of it. Kelly MacFarland, director of programs and research at Georgetown University’s Institute for the Study of Diplomacy, says he expects QAnon to be the most long-lasting and dangerous conspiracy theory, citing a conspiracy theorist who shot at a Washington, D.C., pizzeria in 2016 believing it was tied to the child trafficking sex ring.\n“It’s the most dangerous because of its following and reach, its complete disassociation from truth and reality, and we have an actual real-life example [of violence],” MacFarland said.\nThough 2020 set a new bar for claims that the U.S. presidential election was rigged, President Trump helped originate the idea before he entered the White House in 2016.\nAfter several polls inaccurately predicted that Hilary Clinton would win the 2016 presidential election, Trump suggested that the election was rigged, tweeting that there was “large scale voter fraud” occurring in battleground states. Trump went on to win the election, of course—though not the popular vote—and such claims went quiet.\nBut with Trump facing reelection, the theory took onnew fervor in 2020. The president began building momentum early, suggesting thatmail-in voting would lead to widespread fraud. Conservative commentators quickly echoed his remarks. The effort carried all the way through to Election Day, when armed Trump supporters showed up at some polling locations urging that election officials stop counting ballots. After several court cases and recounts, the theory was dismissed—but that hasn’t stopped conspirators from alleging faulty counting machines and deliberate manual miscounts.\nIn the wake of Trump losing the election to Democratic challenger Joe Biden, Trump and his allies have lost nearly 60 legal battles pertaining to election integrity. Still, Trump has not backed down from his stance that the election was a fraud and stolen from him.\n“Because it has gotten so much attention from the highest level of the U.S. government, this is going to emerge as part of the pantheon of conspiracy theories,” said Joshua Tucker, co-director of New York University’s Social Media and Political Participation lab. “Whether Biden actually won the election will [be grouped] with the JFK shooting and whether we landed on the moon … which is crazy.”\n• When to expect $600 checksand $300 enhanced unemployment payments\n• Everything jobless Americans need to know aboutthe $300 unemployment benefit\n• COVID vaccine recipients may still be infectious.When will we know for sure?\n• Thebiggest conspiracy theories of 2020(and why they won’t die)\n• A brief history ofBitcoin bubbles\nThis story was originally featured onFortune.com\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":33,\"stop_loss\":44730.34,\"take_profit\":51159.77,\"forecast_10d\":[52149.01, 51679.80, 55888.13, 56099.52, 57539.95, 54207.32, 48824.43, 49705.33, 47093.85, 46339.76]}"}

View comments || While many of us were buying last-minute Christmas presents of socks and aftershave, in Argentina, it looks as if the focus was on Bitcoin. According to incredible stats compiled by CoinDance, Bitcoin trading in Argentina skyrocketed to an all-time high in the run-up to Christmas. Peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading in Argentina CoinDance measures the volume of transactions over time on peer-to-peer (P2P) platforms. It found that Bitcoin trading in Argentina in the week of December 21 reached a staggering $32.6 million Argentine pesos (approximately $544,905 US dollars). Thats 34% more than the volume registered in previous weeks and marks a historical record in P2P trading on LocalBitcoins  a platform popular in the Latin American country. Bitcoin trading in Argentina While Bitcoin trading in Argentina has cooled off again since reaching its peak, the increased trading volume in December demonstrates Argentinas growing interest in Bitcoin. At 55.44% at the end of 2019, inflation in Argentina is among the highest in the world. This makes it impossible for Argentines to save in their national currency. But why was there such a spike in peer-to-peer Bitcoin trading in Argentina the week of December 21? A historic distrust of its national currency Argentines historically distrust their national currency  and with good reason. Its let them down many times before with wide-scale devaluations and banking crises. This has fostered an obsession with dollars in the country. Many Argentines wishing to save or carry out transactions on high-ticket items instinctively convert their pesos to dollars. Since President Macris sweeping defeat in October, in an attempt to prevent capital flight, the Argentine central bank restricted the purchase of foreign currency to just $200 per month per citizen. On Tuesday December 17, the new Argentine government led by Alberto Fernández announced a new series of measures to further hamper access to dollars and foster a new love of the peso. Story continues The first of which is abolishing a tax on saving in pesos. We need to recover savings in our currency, said the new Minister of Economy, Martín Guzmán, as he announced that the tax on savings in pesos was being written off. We also need to discourage savings in a currency that we do not produce, which are dollars, he added. Therefore, in addition to the $200 monthly limit, Argentines will pay a 30% tax for the purchase of dollars and for any expenses abroad. These include tourism (making it harder for Argentines to travel) and even services such as Netflix, Airbnb, and Spotify. The tax will not affect expenses related to health, medications, books, and research projects. These measures are part of the so-called Law of Solidarity and Productive Reactivation that the government plans to push through parliament. According to Guzmán, it is the first step to resolve the economic and social crisis that Argentina is going through. 70% of funds collected with the dollar tax will go to the social security system, while the remaining 30% will finance infrastructure and housing works in the country. Solidarity law pushing Argentines to Bitcoin The reasons behind the Law of Solidarity and Productive Reactivation may be well-intended. However, its hard to change a mindset built up over the years and encourage trust in the peso again. Its certainly no coincidence that the spike in Bitcoin trading in Argentina resulted shortly after the new measures were announced. Argentina is not the only country in Latin America to have a tendency towards P2P BTC trading. Venezuela also reached an all-time high that same week, representing a 15.6% increase from the week before. Argentinas ravaged neighbours to the north, in fact, are still showing more and more interest in Bitcoin trading, registering another all-time high the week of January 4. Bitcoin trading in Venezuela Bitcoin  a new Latin American alternative? Argentina and Venezuela are in the throes of complicated economic and financial crises. The situation in Venezuela is far worse, with annual inflation of over 10 million percent . However, the Argentine peso is also being weakened on an almost daily basis. Both countries are also struggling to attract investment and have restricted access to international credit. The devaluation of local currencies is one of the main reasons specialised investors and a young tech-savvy population have turned to Bitcoin  as an alternative to escape monetary depreciation and shield their wealth. However, the enormous obstacles and restrictions on access to foreign exchange have further boosted P2P Bitcoin trading in Argentina and Venezuela. These activities are not yet regulated by current legislation and have allowed investors to quickly exchange their local currency for units or fractions of cryptocurrencies that are traded internationally. Bitcoin may have been born from the ashes of the last global economic meltdown, but the majority of its users are treating it as a store of value. For countries like Argentina and Venezuela, Bitcoin is truly proving to be a viable way of escaping erroneous economic policies and weak local fiat currencies.

President Xi Jinping called on his country to “seize the opportunity” in order to become a leader in blockchain technology as it tries to do likewise with artificial intelligence.\\nThis could be an opportunity for China, which has already become the world’s leading trading nation, to stand up to the first economic world power and flex its muscles. But how significant is this move, and what happens if China really wins the blockchain race? “For the Chinese, digitizing the renminbi is a way to get out from under the U.S.’s thumb,” said Eswar Prasad, an economics professor at Cornell University and former head of the IMF’s China Division. China’s goal isn’t necessarily to overthrow the dollar either. Prasad added, “but they want to give their allies an alternative to the dollar and create a system that couldn’t be disrupted by the U.S.”\\nBlockchain: The technological democracy\\nSatoshi Nakamoto introduced Bitcoin in October 2008 in response to the financial crisis and as an alternative to banks. As the currency was gaining popularity, the underlying technology quickly became a model for creating the so-called trustless systems. “Blockchain allows the tracking of various transactions ensuring immutability and incorruptibility of such records,” explained Raja Sharif, a qualified U.K. barrister and CEO of FarmaTrust, a company that tracks medical supplies via blockchain, in a private interview. He continued:\\n“Blockchain can be used for cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin but can also be used for other purposes e.g. supply chain management, land registries, record keeping, and other transaction management.”\\nThe trustless, almost hackproof and identified transactions that blockchain provides caused many to call it Web 3.0 or “the next internet.” Sharif added:\\n“China has clearly decided that blockchain and artificial intelligence technologies are important to help her reach a global dominant commercial position. It is easy to see why they would want to focus on these technologies… Once one can ensure data integrity, AI capabilities and results can be much better and trusted. These two advantages can help China accelerate its strategic imperative of trade dominance.”\\nOf course, China is still far from public, trustless systems. The country has only welcomed private and much more restrictive blockchains while still being at odds with cryptocurrencies. But this move could make China’s renminbi the preferred currency for trading ー cross-border, online and eventually, offline. Since the sham-communist, practically capitalist regime still sticks to centralized methods of ruling, like the iron repression of dissidents and pure censorship, leading a decentralized revolution remains a philosophical question.\\nRelated: 2019 to 2020: The Insiders, Outsiders and Experimenters in Crypto Regulation, Part 2\\nWhat’s at stake\\nBlockchain projects have struggled for real-life use. Other than generating new “overnight millionaires,” they have not offered a service the world could not live without. Bitcoin remains the most popular blockchain tech by market cap, while some projects claim they are two generations more advanced, introducing features like smart contracts and scalability. This underlines the importance of adoption: It’s not necessarily the more advanced tech that wins, but how much people believe in the project and actually use it.\\nThat’s what made Libra an alarming development, and many countries actively opposed it. It has the potential to onboard billions of people and make crypto mainstream overnight ー a dream many crypto enthusiasts have been waiting for. Now, China is in a similar position, but this time it would be China’s yuan and blockchain.\\nWith China taking the lead, the U.S. dollar would be undermined. It will not be as easy for U.S. regulators to halt a Chinese blockchain as it was for them to block Libra or Telegram’s ICO. Just as we saw during the trade war, blocking Huawei from U.S. markets did not stop China’s race for 5G superiority. But more important than losing the dollar’s hegemony is losing the domination of our values.\\nWhen it comes to international technological battles, the cold war has taught us a valuable lesson. The space race between the U.S. and the USSR wasn’t about who’s going to land on the moon first. Rather, it was a struggle of values deep down in people’s hearts and minds.\\nDecay\\nThe internet was mainly built on western values: openness and democracy. This allowed the U.S. to take the jump on its competitors and dominate the global market. As China becomes more of an industrial and technological superpower, its influence is forcing western companies to play by its rules.\\nGoogle, once loved for advocating open access and fighting censorship, secretly worked on a Chinese version of its search engine called Dragonfly, and thus became a tool of the Chinese government to filter out human rights-related search results and websites. Activision-Blizzard, a popular game development company, punished a gamer who had expressed support for pro-democracy protests in Hong Kong. This makes sense, since the Chinese giant Tencent owns a share of Activision-Blizzard.\\nWhile both examples cited above were pulled back to some degree after facing heavy backlash, the worrying trend persists. The NBA felt the pain after Houston Rockets General Manager Daryl Morey tweeted in favor of the Hong Kong protests, which resulted in all 11 of the NBA's official Chinese partners suspending ties, threatening the league to lose at least 10% of its revenue. Subsequently, LeBron James, who was praised for his advocacy for the Black Lives Matter movement, called Morey misinformed, a position which backfired on the NBA star. As long as short-term gains are favored over strategic benefits, we can expect more decay in western values. So, the question still remains: Are we dealing with a technological race or the balance of power?\\nFor the sake of liberty\\nIt is unrealistic to expect companies, in general, to turn down huge profits. However, better cooperation between the public and private sectors could be a good start. The administration’s inaction and the regulators’ continuous skepticism without any determination to address the inevitable are not stopping the bad actors or our adversaries from taking advantage of the unregulated. Failing to do so, particularly when it comes to blockchain technology, would leave the doors open for China to win the race and not only affect the economy but also our principles.\\nThe views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.\\nPaul McNeil is a tech analyst specializing in the political and moral perspectives of today’s innovative world.

At the time the financial institution (Banque du Liban or BDL) imposed cash withdrawal limits across the country and bank customers were only allowed to withdraw $1,000 per week. These days, long lines at ATMs and bank branches are a common sight in Lebanon. After the withdrawal restrictions, Lebanese citizens began protesting as the nationwide cash crisis saw emptied ATMs and a slew of banking institutions closed. The problems continued into November, as banks remained closed because they were constantly dealing with protestors and angry clients.

The demonstration ended with a 10-hour standoff between a customer and the bank&#x2019;s officials. The customer said he wouldn&#x2019;t leave the bank branch unless he was compensated with his money, but he was escorted out by law enforcement to a local hospital. As the man was ushered to the clinic, bank officials promised the man his funds were safe.

According to the report, Kraken received 710 requests last year (or two per day), impacting approximately 1,222 accounts. The report provides further evidence that exchanges are coming under intense scrutiny as global governments get tough on crypto. Also read: Problems Escalate in Venezuela as Millions Rush to Spend Petros A Growing Trend As noted by Kraken in its tweet publicizing the latest Transparency Report, the “trend is obvious,” with costs associated with handling law enforcement requests increasing even in a relatively flat market. To underline this point, the exchange reposted its 2018 Transparency Report. Since then, Kraken has noted a whopping 49% increase in global requests (710 vs 475). 62% of those resulted in Kraken providing data, with U.S. authorities constituting the majority of requests (61%) followed by Great Britain and the Netherlands. Crypto and fiat currency exchange Wirex has reported even greater growth in LE queries for 2019. Michael Moore, Chief Compliance Office at Wirex, told news.Bitcoin.com: We’ve seen over the course of the last 12 months a steady increase in law enforcement inquiries that we have received, with double the amount being received in 2019 vs 2018. This is to be expected as the company continues to grow and take on more customers. It also reaffirms the need for the industry to be vigilant and the need for compliance. Moore also spoke of “efforts made by disreputable individuals and organizations to target the fintech industry” including fraudsters and money launderers. “These factors, among others,” he concluded “justify the continuous investment Wirex makes in its infrastructure, ensuring we have the right systems for both known and unknown scenarios.&#8221; As for the law enforcement agencies that contacted Kraken last year, the FBI and DEA were predictably top of the list. However, despite over 60% of requests coming from U.S. agencies, fewer than 40% of account-holders were American citizens. Whether it be subpoenas (by far the most common request), summonses or European Investigative Orders, these attempts to lean on exchanges are nothing new. Government agencies and financial market regulators have long demonized the industry as a haven for scam artists, money launderers and criminals, and as such flex their legal muscles to compel exchanges to bow to their demands. Agencies such as the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Department of Justice, and the Commodity Futures Trading Commission are accustomed to knocking on crypto exchange doors. Kraken’s report comes just a few days before the EU’s Fifth Anti-Money Laundering Directive (AMLD5) comes into effect. AMLD5 is expected to increase Know Your Customer (KYC) enforcement, with stricter controls on buying and selling cryptocurrency and increased compliance. Indeed, it has already led to the shutdown of crypto payment processor Bottle Pay and bitcoin faucet Chopcoin. One of the 22 bills involving cryptocurrencies set to be considered by Congress in 2020, meanwhile, considers how cryptos might be used in a range of illegal activities, such as evading U.S. sanctions, human trafficking, and terrorism. The Cost of Handling LE Requests Bitcoiners who value their privacy are likely to be concerned by the findings of Kraken’s Transparency Report. An increasing number of exchanges are enforcing rigorous KYC/AML to appease regulators, with compliance standards becoming ever more Orwellian. When Binance’s Singapore platform threatened to suspend a user for withdrawing to a coin mixing service, it was interpreted as the shape of things to come. Setting aside user concerns, the cost burden facing exchanges pressurized by law enforcement is substantial; Kraken CEO Jesse Powell says the company spent $1 million handling such requests last year. Even with a dedicated compliance team, the effort in gauging the legitimacy of LE requests and then sifting through customer transaction data, transaction IDs, names, email addresses, IP addresses, and other particulars is onerous. As indicated by the Kraken report, 28% of requests in 2019 were “non-valid,” meaning they “did not meet local legal requirements and/or our internal Law Enforcement production policy.” In other words, 28% of requests faced justified resistance on the part of the exchange and were summarily rejected. However, such a vetting process takes time, effort and money. As for the requests that passed muster, Shapeshift CEO Erik Voorhees was correct in noting, “The government is spending Kraken’s money to do police work.” What are your thoughts on Kraken revealing an increase in LE requests?

On November 20th, 2019, Utopia's global launch event will be hosted by its Thailand community. A new site has been launched previously by Utopia for experienced cryptocurrency investors and newbies who want to learn more about creating a strong, steady passive income. The site offers practical information and training on how to utilize the correct Bitcoin investment strategy, along with an affiliate program, to create well above-average returns. Why Did We Create Utopia? In the existing world money works for the banks, producing profit for them as the public utilizes the currency. They can issue more currency and the public will happily pay the banks more money to use it. In this way, the public is serving the money and the money is serving the banks. This is how the centralized financial system creates a hierarchy and maintains the gap between the rich and the poor. \"Today, we have the opportunity to apply blockchain technology and spirit to build a new financial system that is independent of the existing financial system and exists in the virtual online world. Everyone is an owner in the system where contributions are rewarded equably. This is a new system of fairness and integrity. The system also represents the voice of most people around the world. People will be happy because they make money easily\", said Utopia CEO, Shaun Mendes. The origin of Utopia Originated from the concept of ideal world proposed by Plato, the ancient Greek philosopher, Utopia claims that it is striving to build a new, ideal digital ecosystem and apply blockchain technology to secure everyone's involvement in the running of the enterprise. But what does the new, ideal digital ecosystem look like? Well, it looks like an ideal world, since it returns to the model of \"money serves people.\" With blockchain as its fundamental technology, Utopia possesses the underlying qualities of transparency, equality and reliability. Utopia claims that there's no exploitation, no manipulation, and no money in the form of today's currency. Story continues Utopia combines with BTC to reach global consensus and belief What Is Utopia's Grand Strategy? With hundreds of thousands of global users, Utopia is dedicated to creating a new form of financial and social networks. Utopia is said to run by everyone in its network. To reach a broader consensus, Utopia combines its development with BTC. It is anticipated that it will jointly popularize BTC and promote the growth of BTC/USD exchange rate. Meanwhile, Utopia distributes 100 percent of its profits to all of those who have a consensus on the idea of Utopia. The birth of Utopia resulted from BTC, and the birth of BTC resulted from people's wish to sort out the problems caused by the existing finance and currency system. As an unprecedented breakthrough, the underlying technology of bitcoin is gradually establishing the new financial order. Whilst Utopia is not only a firm supporter of the financial order, but also a forward innovator. Utopia is an \"ideal world\" created by bitcoin believers and holders all over the world, whose goal is to popularize bitcoin, promote the growth of BTC/USD exchange rate, and distribute 100 percent its revenue to every Utopia idea disseminator. The total amount of bitcoins in circulation is only 21 million, and the number will never increase again. At present, more than 17 million bitcoins have been mined out, among which about 4-4.5 million can't be found due to the loss of private key. Thus, only about 13 million are actually in circulation. As the wind vane of blockchain economy, bitcoin now has the most extensive consensus in the world. Based on blockchain technology, big data, cryptographic algorithm and so on, Utopia has built a super self-reliant financial system driven by the financial system of bitcoin consensus and trust, so that every bitcoin participant can obtain huge victory benefits. Utopia is a new highlight of the digital world The great thing about bitcoin is that it breaks the centralization of currency and introduces cryptocurrency and blockchain to the world. Whilst Utopia is to break the financial barrier of the world, build a new system of global digital blockchain assets, and popularize BTC through accurate calculation and reasonable economic model. Utopia achieves a high level of global consensus via taking BTC as the underlying application, and realizes a decentralized blockchain world via implementing the multi-signature mechanism of BTC. The BTC assets deposited by each user of Utopia will be jointly owned by 10 + N members, and there will be no such problems as central control and run-away. In the world of Utopia, everyone is the owner. In order to make Utopia develop better, based on the reliable economic model on the blockchain, Utopia designed the daily interest rate and annual compound interest rate targeting different needs of participants, ensuring the sustainable income of all participants and the long-term and stable development of Utopia. Utopia assets adopt bitcoin multi-signature mechanism to ensure the safety of each participant's assets. Only by the agreement of 66.66% of the users participating in the multi-signature account can one withdraw the assets in Utopia. Utopia is dedicated to the realization of true decentralization and everyone's participation in the management of the new world of Utopia. The future is at the corner. Utopia is quietly changing the world and our lives with blockchain technology and its unique development concept.

Let’s study the charts of the top 10 cryptocurrencies to find out.BTC/USDTBitcoin bounced off the $22,800 support on Feb. 1, indicating that bulls are buying the dip to this level. The bulls pushed the price above $24,000 on Feb. 2 but could not sustain the higher levels. BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe rising moving averages and the relative strength (RSI) in the overbought zone indicate that the path of least resistance is to the upside. If the price rises from the current $22,800, the BTC/USDT pair could surge to $25,000. This level is likely to act as a formidable barrier.The first sign of weakness will be a break and close below the 20-day exponential moving average (EMA) ($22,279). That could trigger the stops of several short-term traders and the pair could fall to $21,480.ETH/USDTBuyers propelled Ether (ETH) above the overhead resistance of $1,680 on Feb. 2, but they could not sustain the breakout. The price gave up all the gains on the day and closed below $1,680.ETH/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe upsloping 20-day EMA ($1,571) and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls are in control. They may again attempt to overcome the overhead barrier at $1,680 and start the journey to $2,000. The $1,800 level may provide some resistance, but it is likely to be crossed.Bears will have to sell aggressively and yank the price below the 20-day EMA if they want to gain the upper hand. If they can pull it off, the ETH/USDT pair may decline to $1,500 and if this support cracks, the pullback could eventually reach $1,352.BNB/USDTBNB’s (BNB) tight-range trading between the 20-day EMA ($306) and the overhead resistance at $318 resolved to the upside on Feb. 2.BNB/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewAlthough bears sold the rally on Feb. 2, a positive sign is that the buyers did not allow the price to slide back below the breakout level of $318. This suggests that the bulls are trying to flip the $318 level into support. If they can pull it off, the BNB/USDT pair could skyrocket to $360, as there is no major barrier in between.If bears want to halt the up-move, they will have to pull the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then drop to the 50-day simple moving average (SMA) of $276.XRP/USDTXRP (XRP) once again turned down from the $0.42 resistance on Feb. 2, indicating that bears are trying to protect this level.XRP/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe price is squeezed between the 20-day EMA ($0.40) and $0.42. This suggests a breakout may be around the corner. The gradually upsloping 20-day EMA and the RSI in the positive territory indicate that bulls have the upper hand. This increases the possibility of a break above $0.42. If that happens, the XRP/USDT pair could soar to $0.51.Contrary to this assumption, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, the decline could extend to the 50-day SMA ($0.37).ADA/USDT Attempts by the bears to sink Cardano (ADA) below the 20-day EMA ($0.37) failed on Feb. 1. The bulls fiercely defended the level, as seen from the long tail on the candlestick.ADA/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe negative divergence on the RSI points to weakening momentum but the upsloping 20-day EMA suggests that buyers have the edge. If the price turns up from the current level, the bulls will again try to catapult the ADA/USDT pair toward the overhead resistance at $0.44.On the contrary, if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA, it will signal that traders may be booking profits. That could open the doors for a potential drop to the 50-day SMA ($0.31).DOGE/USDTThe long tail on Dogecoin’s (DOGE) Feb. 1 candlestick shows that the bulls aggressively purchased the dip to the 20-day EMA ($0.08). However, buyers failed to build upon this strength and overcome the barrier at $0.10.DOGE/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe DOGE/USDT pair is stuck between the 20-day EMA and $0.10.

The long wick on the day’s candlestick suggests that short-term traders may have booked profits at higher levels.MATIC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewA positive sign is that the bulls did not cede ground to the bears and are attempting to push the price to the target objective of $1.30. This level may again act as a strong barrier, but if buyers bulldoze their way through, the MATIC/USDT pair could reach $1.70.Alternatively, if the price turns down sharply from the current level, the MATIC/USDT pair could drop to $1.05. This is an important level to keep an eye on because a bounce off it could keep the pair range-bound between $1.05 and $1.30 for a few days. LTC/USDTLitecoin (LTC) continued its northward march and skyrocketed above the psychological level of $100 on Feb. 1. This rise may have tempted short-term traders to book profits.LTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe LTC/USDT pair could enter a minor correction, but the bulls will likely buy the dip to the 20-day EMA ($90). If the price rises from the current level or rebounds off the 20-day EMA, the bulls will try to extend the up-move to $107.This positive view could invalidate in the near term if the price turns down and breaks below the 20-day EMA. Such a move will indicate that the bulls may be rushing to the exit. The pair could then slump to $81 and later to $75.DOT/USDTPolkadot (DOT) bounced off the 20-day EMA ($6.21) on Feb. 1 and broke above the overhead resistance of $6.84 on Feb. 2. The bulls could not maintain the higher levels as seen from the long wick on the Feb. 2 candlestick.DOT/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewA positive sign is that the bulls did not allow the price to break back below the resistance line. This indicates that traders are trying to flip this level into support. Buyers will have to sustain the price above $7 to gain control. The DOT/USDT pair could then surge to $8 where it may face strong resistance from the sellers.If bears want to regain control, they will have to quickly sink the price back below the 20-day EMA. The pair could then enter a corrective phase and plummet to $5.50.AVAX/USDTAvalanche (AVAX) soared above the overhead resistance at $22 on Feb. 2, but the long wick on the day’s candlestick shows that bears are selling on rallies.AVAX/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewThe rising moving averages suggest that bulls are in command, but the negative divergence on the RSI indicates that the momentum may be weakening. If buyers do not give up much ground from the current level, the likelihood of a break above $22 increases. The AVAX/USDT pair could then attempt a rally to $30.Contrarily, if the price slips below $20.50, the pair could reach the resistance line.

Noting that this percentage was up from 73.3% in 2021, the firm pointed out that $3.1 billion of 64% came from cross-chain bridge protocols specifically. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Chainalysis also detailed that &#8220;North Korea-linked hackers … have been by far the most prolific cryptocurrency hackers over the last few years,&#8221; elaborating: In 2022, they shattered their own records for theft, stealing an estimated $1.7 billion worth of cryptocurrency across several hacks we&#8217;ve attributed to them. Moreover, the blockchain analytics firm stated that North Korea-linked hackers stole $1.1 billion of that amount from defi protocols, making North Korea &#8220;one of the driving forces behind the defi hacking trend that intensified in 2022.&#8221; Besides defi protocols, Chainalysis noted that &#8220;North Korea-linked hackers also tend to send large sums to mixers, which have typically been the cornerstone of their money laundering process.&#8221; The firm further detailed that &#8220;For much of 2021 and 2022, North Korea-linked hackers almost exclusively used Tornado Cash to launder cryptocurrency stolen in hacks.&#8221; Ethereum mixer Tornado Cash was sanctioned by the U.S. government in August last year.

Gopax fell into trouble following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and the bankruptcy filing of crypto lender Genesis Global. Binance Invests in Troubled Korean Crypto Exchange Cryptocurrency exchange Binance announced Friday that it has invested in Gopax, a licensed crypto exchange in South Korea. The investment marks Binance&#8217;s return to the Korean crypto market, which the company exited two years ago, citing low usage and trading volume. Gopax halted withdrawals of both principal and interest payments from its decentralized finance (defi) service &#8220;Gofi&#8221; in November last year &#8220;as a consequence of the upstream challenges experienced by Genesis Global Capital LLC,&#8221; Binance detailed. &#8220;Since then, Gopax has been working closely with local regulators and industry partners in an effort to raise funds to make affected users whole.&#8221; The global crypto exchange explained: As part of this transaction, Binance will inject capital into Gopax with the objective of securing in full any potential Gofi users&#8217; withdrawal requests against all staked deposits, including interest. Gofi&#8217;s products are provided by its partner, Genesis Global Capital, a subsidiary of Digital Currency Group (DCG), Gopax previously explained. Genesis halted redemptions and new loan originations at its lending arm General Global Trading in November following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX. The crypto lender then filed for bankruptcy in January following a lawsuit by the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) alleging that the company offered and sold unregistered securities to retail investors. Gopax&#8217;s parent company Streami Inc. is listed as one of Genesis Global&#8217;s 10 largest known creditors in the bankruptcy filing. According to Binance&#8217;s chief business officer, Yibo Ling, the company has taken a &#8220;meaningful&#8221; equity stake in Gopax but the terms of the deal have not been disclosed. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Binance Aims to Help Rebuild the Korean Crypto and Blockchain Industry Binance&#8217;s stake in Gopax is part of its Industry Recovery Initiative (IRI), launched in November last year following the collapse of crypto exchange FTX and the bankruptcy filings of several crypto firms.

Love that this sub exists!! I was thinking of some possible ways to, as the post title says, avoid this sub becoming the target of selfdxrs who come here to argue (endlessly) over self diagnosis and all the nonsense that accompanies selfdx. It just seems really exhausting to have that happen constantly.\\n\\nSome initial thoughts based on what I\\'ve seen work in other such subs (mostly Buttcoin, the Bitcoin/crytocurrency snark sub). I propose a list of \"things that will get you banned\", which could be part of the welcome message and include, for instance, \"arguing in bad faith\". So if people are constantly going on and on with the same old selfdx lines, boom! Banhammer.\\n\\nAnother idea I had (also from Buttcoin) was the use of flairs to identify, in this sub\\'s context, selfdxrs. And hiding your user flair gets you banned (assuming this sub doesn\\'t go the way of fakedisordercringe such that everyone can choose a user flair if they want).\\n\\nAny thoughts or ideas? Just tossing a few things out there!\\n\\nEdit because I forgot: I know we\\'re small but we MUST censor usernames and identifying info for other users or we risk the sub being permabanned for harassment/brigading!

The other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization also retreated after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Gary Gensler said the crypto industry is running out of time to comply with securities laws. He spoke on Wednesday in an interview with Yahoo Finance . See related article: SEC’s Gensler says proof-of-stake cryptocurrencies may be securities Fast facts Bitcoin fell 1.4% to US$16,847 in the 24 hours to 8 a.m. in Hong Kong, while Ether dropped 3.1% to trade at US$1,232 according to CoinMarketCap . Leading memecoin Dogecoin saw the biggest losses in CoinMarketCap’s list, falling 4.4% to US$0.095. Polkadot lost 3.7% to US$5.30. Litecoin also fell 3.7% to trade at US$76.96. Gensler said his agency had sufficient authority to begin holding digital asset firms accountable to securities regulation. Gensler said crypto exchanges and lending platforms need to come into compliance with those regulations. “They can do that appropriately, working with the SEC, or we can continue on a course with more enforcement actions, and I would have to say that the runway’s getting shorter,” he said. Gensler said that many crypto firms have been running co-mingled platforms offering lending, trading, hedge funds etc, and such practices will need to end. He did not specifically address the collapse of Bahamas-based crypto exchange FTX.com. It has been alleged FTX used customer funds from its exchange to trade crypto and make investments through its affiliated brokerage Alameda Research. Gensler said in September that any proof-of-stake cryptocurrency, such as the US$150 billion Ethereum network , should be considered a security. U.S. equities finished mostly lower on Wednesday. The Nasdaq Composite Index lost 0.5% and the S&P 500 Index finished 0.2% lower for its fifth consecutive day of losses. The Dow Jones Industrial Average was little changed. Investors see a recent run of bullish economic indicators conflicting with the comments of U.S. Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell last week, when he said the central bank may start to ease the pace of interest rate increases to slow inflation. U.S. services industry activity came in at 56.5% in November, according to the monthly survey by the Institute for Supply Management released on Monday. A reading of 50% or greater shows the economy is growing, while 55% is considered to be very strong. The U.S. jobs report out Friday showed the economy added 263,000 positions in November or more than the 200,000 expected. The Fed has increased interest rates since March to try to slow inflation, raising from near zero to a 15-year high of 3.75% to 4%, and has signaled that rates may end up exceeding 5%. The Fed has said it wants inflation in a target range of 2%. The consumer price index showed inflation was running at 7.7% in October, down from 8.2% in September.

We will be looking at previous day price action and todays support, resistance, and pivot levels and, when in play, the Fibonaccis. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) slid by 7.54% on Thursday. Reversing a 3.02% gain from Wednesday, Ethereum ended the day at $4,106. A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum rise to an early morning intraday high $4,491 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $4,522, Ethereum slid to a late intraday low $4,076. The extended sell-off saw Ethereum fall through the first major support level at $4,293 and the second major support level at $4,145. Steering clear of sub-$4,000 however, Ethereum briefly broke through the second major support level before ending the day at sub-$4,110 levels. At the time of writing, Ethereum was up by 0.96% to $4,145. A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum fall to an early morning low $4,102 before rising to a high $4,146. Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead Ethereum would need to move through the $4,224 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $4,373 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break out from $4,350 levels. Barring an extended rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $4,400 should limit the upside. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at the $4,700 levels before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $4,639. Failure to move through the $4,224 pivot would bring the first major support level at $3,958 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of sub-$3,850 levels.

A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin fall to an early morning low $151.01 before rising to a high $153.74. Story continues Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead Litecoin would need to move through the $157 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $162 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Litecoin to break back through to $160 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Thursdays high $167.26 would likely cap the upside. In the event of an extended rally, Litecoin could test resistance at the second major resistance level at $173 before any pullback.

Following a 0.27% decline on Wednesday, Bitcoin ended the day at $47,610. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $50,844.0 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $51,610, Bitcoin slid to a late intraday low $47,408. Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $49,061 and the second major support level at $47,619. Steering clear of sub-$47,000, however, Bitcoin briefly broke back through the second major support level before ending the day at $47,610 levels. The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest pullback to $41,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $28,814 to form a near-term bearish trend. The Rest of the Pack Across the rest of the majors, it was a bearish session. Chainlink slid by 11.43% to lead the way down, with Bitcoin Cash SV (-9.69%), Cardanos ADA (-7.66%), Ethereum (-7.54%), and Litecoin (-8.38%) seeing deep red. Binance Coin (-6.10%), Crypto.com Coin (-5.27%) and Polkadot (-4.28%) also struggled. Ripples XRP ended the day down by a more modest 0.42%, however. In the current week, the crypto total market fell to a Monday low $2,124bn before rising to a late Tuesday high $2,417bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $2,227bn. Bitcoins dominance rose to a Monday high 41.96% before falling to a Thursday low 39.95%. At the time of writing, Bitcoins dominance stood at 40.62%. Bitcoins dominance last fell to sub-40% levels back in mid-September. This Morning At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.61% to $47,901. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $47,500 before rising to a high $48,111. Story continues Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day. Bitcoin Cash SV (-0.50%) and Crypto.com Coin (-2.49%) bucked the early trend. It was a bullish start for the rest of the majors, however. At the time of writing, Chainlink was up by 0.99% to lead the way. For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move through the $48,621 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $49,833 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from $49,500 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Thursdays high $50,844 would likely cap the upside. In the event of an extended rally, Bitcoin could test the 23.6% FIB of $53,628 before easing back. The second major resistance level sits at $52,057. Failure to move through the $48,621 pivot would bring the first major support level at $46,397 into play. Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$45,000 levels and the 38.2% FIB of $44,144. The second major support level at $45,185 should limit the downside.

The report noted a 50% decrease in OI after this latest market downturn, as over-leveraged longs positions were decimated. \\nBTC futures open interest vs. BTC price. Source: Delphi DigitalWhile the experience was likely an unpleasant one for traders who were overexposed, the analysts suggested that deleveraging events like this are beneficial over the long term and will often “give way to further upside,” as the previous froth and over-exuberance are replaced with a more measured trading environment. \\nThe sharp reduction in OI over the past month may also be signaling that the short-term bottom for BTC may be in accordance with Delphi Digital, and it's possible that the current sell-off could be reaching the point of exhaustion. \\nDelphi Digital said, \\n“The 30-day % decline in OI for BTC has reached levels that previously signaled a bottom was forming (or wasn’t too far out).”\\nRange-bound trading for BTC until 2022\\nAccording to Ben Lilly, co-founder of Jarvis Labs, the price of Bitcoin is likely “to stay in this trading range until at least the end of the month,” mainly due to the fact that Dec. 31st marks “the largest open interest in terms of open contracts.”\\nLilly highlighted previous instances of major drawdowns resulting in a high number of liquidations as part of the reasoning.

According to Chainalysis, firms like exchanges and virtual asset service providers (VASPs) can leverage the company&#x2019;s Know-Your-Transaction (KYT) real-time transaction monitoring software in order to access compliant bitcoin deposits and withdrawals from a LN node. Compliant Lightning Transactions The blockchain surveillance and intelligence company, Chainalysis, announced on Friday that the company has added Lightning Network (LN) support to its list of blockchain and crypto-asset networks, the company currently monitors. For years, Chainalysis has monitored the Bitcoin (BTC) blockchain, and these days the firm is not only monitoring BTC, but also a myriad of crypto networks and decentralized finance (defi) protocols. Essentially, the LN is an offchain routed &#x201C;layer 2&#x201D; (L2) payment channel network that helps facilitate bitcoin (BTC) transfers faster and cheaper than onchain transactions. The Chainalysis LN support will provide VASPs with &#x201C;Chainalysis KYT (Know-Your-Transaction) for real-time transaction monitoring will now be able to compliantly allow deposits and withdrawals of Bitcoin from a Lightning node.&#x201D; As of December 1, 2021, Chainalysis estimates there is &#x201C;just under 3,600 BTC worth over $205 million is locked in public Lightning Network channels.&#x201D; This has increased a great deal since the total value locked in the LN was around 468 BTC on January 1, 2021. Chainalysis also mentions that the LN L2 system is leveraged by countries such as El Salvador and large corporations like Twitter. Pratima Arora, the chief product officer at Chainalysis explains that the firm hopes compliant LN transfers will help the LN mature. &#x201C;Chainalysis exists to build trust in cryptocurrency in order to promote more financial freedom with less risk,&#x201D; Arora said in a statement. &#x201C;The Lightning Network solves many of the challenges that prevent the Bitcoin protocol from being used for micropayments and other transaction types that bolster financial inclusion. By enabling our customers to compliantly support Lightning transactions, we hope to grow the network&#x2019;s popularity and help it scale.&#x201D; if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Lightning Network Support for Chainalysis KYT Customers to Launch in February Chainalysis has expanded its resources a great deal and faces dozens of blockchain intelligence and monitoring competitors. The company raised $100 million at the end of June in its Series E funding round and the previous C and D rounds also saw $100 million capital injections.

In a blog post called &#x201C;Endgame,&#x201D; published on December 6, the co-founder of Ethereum, Vitalik Buterin discussed plans to improve scaling, the upcoming proof-of-stake transition, and censorship resistance. Buterin Outlines Plausible Ethereum Scaling Roadmap in Endgame Blog Post Vitalik Buterin, the prominent co-founder of the Ethereum project, has outlined his thoughts about a &#x201C;plausible roadmap&#x201D; that could address the network&#x2019;s scaling issues. The blog post dubbed &#x201C;Endgame,&#x201D; explains a few concepts like a &#x201C;second tier of staking with low resource requirements,&#x201D; and introducing fraud proofs or Zk-Snarks where ETH users can &#x201C;cheaply&#x201D; acquire block validity. The roadmap Buterin summarizes aims to improve the blockchain without giving up censorship resistance. &#x201C;What do we get after all of this is done? Buterin asks in his latest blog post. &#x201C;We get a chain where block production is still centralized, but block validation is trustless and highly decentralized, and specialized anti-censorship magic prevents the block producers from censoring.&#x201D; Buterin further adds: It&#x2019;s somewhat aesthetically ugly, but it does provide the basic guarantees that we are looking for: even if every single one of the primary stakers (the block producers) is intent on attacking or censoring, the worst that they could do is all go offline entirely, at which point the chain stops accepting transactions until the community pools their resources and sets up one primary-staker node that is honest. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Buterin Discusses an Ethereum Rollup-Centric Roadmap, Big Block Chains, and Cross-Domain MEVs Buterin&#x2019;s recent blog post follows the discussions that took place at the end of November when Ethereum developers talked about concepts such as EIP-4488. The plan could reduce data transfer costs five times less, and Ethereum developer Tim Beiko shared his thoughts on EIP-4488 and lowering the costs of rollups. In the Endgame blog post, Buterin also talked about leveraging rollups and this technology&#x2019;s &#x201C;possible long-term future.&#x201D; &#x201C;Ethereum is very well-positioned to adjust to this future world, despite the inherent uncertainty,&#x201D; Buterin stresses. &#x201C;The profound benefit of the Ethereum rollup-centric roadmap is that it means that Ethereum is open to all of the futures, and does not have to commit to an opinion about which one will necessarily win.&#x201D; Buterin further added: Ethereum researchers should think hard about what levels of decentralization in block production are actually achievable. It may not be worth it to add complicated plumbing to make highly decentralized block production easy if cross-domain MEV (or even cross-shard MEV from one rollup taking up multiple shards) make it unsustainable regardless. In terms of &#x201C;big block chains&#x201D; Buterin says &#x201C;there is a path for them to turn into something trustless and censorship-resistant, and we&#x2019;ll soon find out if their core developers and communities actually value censorship resistance and decentralization enough for them to do it.&#x201D; Buterin&#x2019;s blog post ends by saying that &#x201C;it will likely take years for all of this to play out.&#x201D; &#x201C;Sharding and data availability sampling are complex technologies to implement. It will take years of refinement and audits for people to be fully comfortable storing their assets in a ZK-rollup running a full EVM,&#x201D; Buterin&#x2019;s Endgame post concludes. &#x201C;And cross-domain MEV research too is still in its infancy. But it does look increasingly clear how a realistic but bright future for scalable blockchains is likely to emerge.&#x201D; What do you think about Vitalik Buterin&#x2019;s Engame blog post concerning scaling and possible roadmaps?

But investors may wonder how appropriate the industry is for the long-term given environmental sustainability concerns. These concerns are particularly relevant to cryptocurrency miners who have received negative press attention for using electricity 24 hours a day to run vast facilities with large-scale computer systems. Since the industry is relatively new, multi-page sustainability reports for these companies are not as readily available as other public corporations, which may add to the negative perception. There are some misconceptions regarding electricity usage, however, and early signs show that most mining companies have taken steps to move toward renewable energy and become more environmentally friendly.\nCryptocurrency mining—what is it and how does it take up energy?\nCryptocurrency mining (usually Bitcoin mining) is essentially the process of verifying blocks of Bitcoin transactions. Miners use computers to “compete” to validate the transactions, which involves running a computer to solve a complex algorithm. Once the algorithm is solved, the transactions are verified by the rest of the network. Miners are incentivized with Bitcoin rewards for solving the problem.\nAs Bitcoin’s popularity rose, it became more difficult to mine for Bitcoin as more computers joined the network and the algorithms evolved (i.e., more computing power is now required). Previously anyone with a computer could mine for Bitcoin, but now the majority of Bitcoin mining is done by Bitcoin mining corporations or groups of individuals who have joined together to form a mining pool. Bitcoin mining companies often have large facilities with networks of computers that require a significant amount of electricity to both run the systems and cool down the subsequent heat generated from the process.\nIn May 2021, Elon Musk stated that Tesla (TSLA) would no longer accept Bitcoin payments due to the increasing usage of fossil fuels for mining.1 Other negative comparisons arose asserting that global Bitcoin mining used more electricity than a small country. But electricity consumption, although increasing, is not as large as many are led to believe.\n1. Elon Musk on Twitter: Tesla & Bitcoin\nAccording to the University of Cambridge, Bitcoin mining consumes about 0.5% of the world’s electricity – around 99 terawatt hours (TWh) per year globally.2 To put this into perspective, gold mining consumes 131 TWh per year. Other industrial processes such as iron and steel production and chemical production consume over 1,200 TWh per year.3 While it is true that global Bitcoin mining consumes more electricity annually than smaller countries like Kazakhstan and the Philippines, electricity consumption is nowhere near annual usage of developed countries like China and the United States. China and the United States generate close to 65x and 40x, respectively, the amount of electricity as Bitcoin does globally. The University of Cambridge study also found that renewable energy accounts for only 39% of total energy consumption for miners; however, 76% of miners utilize some portion of renewable energy—mostly hydroelectric—as part of their energy mix. This illustrates that while total energy consumption may not be as high as opponents may imply, there is still more progress to be made in the industry.\n1. 3rd Global Cryptoasset Benchmarking Study by the University of Cambridge\n2. Cambridge Bitcoin Electricity Consumption Index (CBECI)\nIndustry standards are still in early stages of fruition.\nThe Paris Climate Agreement inspired the Crypto Climate Accord (CCA) in April 2021 in an effort to decarbonize the cryptocurrency and blockchain industry. Its objective is to transition the entire crypto industry to net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2040.4 Over 150 companies have joined as CCA Supporters, which help develop solutions in support of the CCA but have not necessarily made a commitment to decarbonize. Over half of these supporters are also CCA Signatories that commit to achieve net-zero emissions from crypto operations by 2030. As shown in the table below, several crypto mining constituents within the Alerian Galaxy Global Blockchain and Crypto Index Family have signed the CCA—most notably Dmg Blockchain Solutions (DMGI CN) and Argo Blockchain (ARGO), which were the first to sign.\nAdditionally, these large public companies have taken steps to utilize more green energy in their mining operations. Many of these also have mining facilities in colder regions like Western Canada. Canada is abundant with land, wind energy, and natural gas—ranking in the top 5 natural gas producers behind the United States, Russia, and Iran.5 Canada, however, is thought to be the most ideal out of these locations because of more relaxed crypto regulations and freezing temperatures. Operating mining facilities in colder weather regions helps cool the large amount of heat generated by the miners, which lowers the electricity cost.\n1. Crypto Climate Accord\n2. Natural Gas Facts (nrcan.gc.ca)\nBottom Line:\nAs investors consider cryptocurrency and blockchain equities as a long-term thematic investment, they should be aware that environmental sustainability standards are still evolving for this relatively new industry. Although there has traditionally been a negative perception of the Bitcoin mining process, crypto mining companies have started taking steps to address environmental sustainability, which will likely become a much larger topic of interest as the industry grows.\nThe Alerian Galaxy Global Blockchain Equity, Trusts & ETPs Index (BCHAIN) is the underlying index for the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC).\nThe Alerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts & ETPs Index (CRYPTO) is the underlying index for the Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO).\nRelated Research:\nInvesting in the Digital Transformation: Accessing Blockchain and Crypto Through Equity Investments\nStrong Airline Demand Gives Wings to the Travel Industry\nInvesting in Water: Water Brings the Heat in a Defensive Summer\nInvesting in Global Infrastructure: Building the Future Economy\nInvesting in Biotechnology: Disrupting the Healthcare Space\nHealthcare\nS-Network Medical Breakthroughs Index (PMBI)| ALPS Medical Breakthroughs ETF (SBIO)S-NetworkHealthcare Innovation Index (PHIX)| SmartTrust Healthcare Innovations Trust; Available on the C8 platform and the SMArtX platform\nTechnology\nO'Shares Global Internet Giants Index (OGIGX)| O’Shares Global Internet Giants ETF (OGIG)S-Network NorthAmerican Disruptor Index (SNNADX)| SmartTrust Technology Revolution Trust – Includes 30 stocks from SNNADX\nWater\nS-Network Global Water Index (JGI)| Invesco Global Water Portfolio – Includes 25 stocks from JGI; Available on the C8 platform\nSmart Climate Risk\nS-Network Smart Climate Risk 50 Index (SNSC50) | Available on the C8 platform and the SMArtX platform S-Network Smart Climate Risk 250 Index (SNSC250) | Available on the C8 platform\nBlockchain and Crypto\nAlerian Galaxy Global Blockchain Equity, Trusts & ETPs Index(BCHAIN) | Invesco Alerian Galaxy Blockchain Users and Decentralized Commerce ETF (BLKC)\nAlerian Galaxy Global Cryptocurrency-Focused Blockchain Equity, Trusts & ETPs Index (CRYPTO)| Invesco Alerian Galaxy Crypto Economy ETF (SATO)\nOther\nS-Network Infrastructure Builders Index (EIBI)| Available on the C8 platform\nS-Network Space Index (SPACE)| Procure Space ETF (UFO)\nS-Network MicroSectors Gold Miners Index (MINERS)| MicroSectors Gold Miners 3x Leveraged ETN (GDXU), MicroSectors Gold Miners -3x Inverse Leveraged ETN (GDXD)\nS-Network Global Travel Index (TRAVEL)| ALPS Global Travel Beneficiaries ETF (JRNY)\nDisclaimers\nFor more news, information, and strategy, visit theCrypto Channel.\nPOPULAR ARTICLES AND RESOURCES FROM ETFTRENDS.COM\n• SPY ETF Quote\n• VOO ETF Quote\n• QQQ ETF Quote\n• VTI ETF Quote\n• JNUG ETF Quote\n• Top 34 Gold ETFs\n• Top 34 Oil ETFs\n• Top 57 Financials ETFs\n• AdvisorShares Launches the Poseidon Dynamic Cannabis ETF, PSDN\n• Why Today’s Bond Market Demands Active Management\n• Four ETF Strategies to Diversify in Today’s Market Environment\n• Retail ETFs Are Mixed Amid Optimistic Walmart Financial Data\n• Schwab Launches the Schwab Ariel ESG ETF, SAEF\nREAD MORE AT ETFTRENDS.COM >\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":27,\"stop_loss\":44597.30,\"take_profit\":50746.94,\"forecast_10d\":[49362.51, 50098.34, 46737.48, 46612.63, 48896.72, 47665.43, 46202.14, 46848.78, 46707.02, 46880.28]}"}

The BTC prices seem to be locked in a tight range around the $6400 region and this has been the case for the last 1 week or so. It is expected to continue in the short term as we do not expect any major fundamental or economic changes to affect the cryptocurrency market for now. It is likely that the altcoins begin to feel the pinch of lack of interest and volatility in the crypto markets and the traders in those markets are likely to begin dumping the coins and this could add to the bearishness in the market.\nThere has not been much news around except that one of the co-founders of a large exchange in India, Unocoin, has been arrested for running the country’s first BTC ATM in one of the malls in Bangalore in India. This is a continuation of the crackdown of the authorities in India against the cryptos though the details of the case are yet to emerge at this point of time. Apart from this news, the market has been slow and as we have been saying over the last many weeks, the market and the prices seem to have become immune to such developments which is also another reason for the low volatility.\nThe ETH prices continue to trade in a low and slow manner over the last 24 hours but it appears as though the traders and the investors are beginning to lose interest in the proceedings as far as the ETH market is concerned.

The floods damaged around 17,000 houses.Binance subsequently called for donations in digital currency from individuals and industry players to help residents affected by the heavy downpours. Per the post, the exchange managed to raise $1.41 million in various types of ERC20 tokens.Later, Binance reached out to local non-governmental organizations (NGOs), companies and governmental agencies to “support the frontline donation operation.” As of Oct. 15, the exchange completed donation distributions among local intermediaries to the value of 63.03 bitcoins (BTC) and 169.85 Ethereum (ETH), which at the time of their distribution were worth 56,700,000 yen ($505,545).Binance distribution of digital currencies for flood relief in Japan.

She then converted BTC to yen and transferred 25 million yen ($222,910) both to the Momotaro Fund and Peace Winds Japan to support the victims.The second round of donations was conducted using digital currencies directly, as volunteer service provider Open Japan opened a cryptocurrency account. Binance transferred 169.85 ETH (5.3 million yen, or $47,257 at that time) to the organization. Binance also donated 1.943 BTC to Bic Camera to acquire appliances for temporary shelters in Kure City.Commenting on the donation, Open Japan reportedly said that “it was carried out instantly, and after confirming the transfer we were able to convert it to Japanese yen. Receiving this donation left us with a deep impression of cryptocurrency: both its growing effect on our world and its potential.”Earlier this month, Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao said that he “hoped others would follow” his decision to donate all listing fees to charity. Binance announced that it will not only donate all such fees to charitable causes for the “greater good,” but will also allow developers themselves to name the amount they pay, without demanding a minimum fee.Charity actions with cryptocurrency have been gaining traction over the last few years.

We shall turn positive on the ETH/USD pair if it sustains above $250.A break out of the range can carry the price to $322, which might act as a stiff resistance. Traders should wait for a confirmed breakout above $250 before initiating any long positions.XRP/USDRipple’s volatility has died down. Both moving averages and the RSI are flattening out, which shows a balance between the buyers and the sellers.The resistances on the upside are $0.5, $0.55 and $0.625, whereas the two support levels are at $0.388 and $0.37.We suggest traders wait until the XRP/USD pair attracts more buying interest. We might propose long positions when we find a reliable buy setup above $0.5.BCH/USDThough Bitcoin Cash is trading inside a symmetrical triangle, the price has been hugging the support line for the past few days, which is a negative sign.The moving averages are gradually sloping down and the RSI is in the negative territory. This shows that the bears have an upper hand.A breakdown of the triangle will resume the downtrend and can plunge the BCH/USD pair to the next support at $300. Therefore, the traders can keep a stop loss of $400, just below the Sept. 11 intraday lows. The pair will turn bullish if the price breaks out of the triangle and sustains above it.EOS/USDThe intraday range in EOS has shrunk in the past few days. The moving averages and the price are all bundled close to each other, with the RSI close to the neutral territory.

The approval means that the Japan Virtual Currency Exchange Association, a coalition&#xA0;of several registered digital currency exchanges, can now set rules for operational requirements, consumer protection, prevention of money laundering and employee ethics. The association will also enforce compliance.

Exchanges in the Pacific Island nation are desperate to regain public trust after two major digital currency heists earlier this year. An unnamed senior Financial Services Agency official&#xA0;told&#xA0;Reuters: &#x201C;It&#x2019;s a very fast moving industry. It&#x2019;s better for experts to make rules in a timely manner than bureaucrats.&#x201D; Last year, Japan became the first country to regulate virtual currency trading platforms, as part of efforts to encourage technological innovation while safeguarding consumer assets. Exchanges must register with the FSA, and 16 have done so to date. But a succession of attacks by hackers has struck at the very heart of the Japanese cryptocurrency industry. In January, thieves made off with $530 million from the Tokyo-based exchange Coincheck, a hack rivaling Mt. Gox&#x2019;s as one of the largest ever for cryptocurrency. Hackers also stole about $60 million from Zaif in September, an exchange owned by Osaka-based Tech Bureau Corp. The heists have forced the FSA to institute stringent legislative guidelines to help safeguard customer funds while sanctioning exchanges that fail to comply. Stricter Rules Under Industry Association Regulation Yuri Suzuki, senior partner at law firm Atsumi & Sakai, explained that the rules under self-regulation are much tougher compared with existing laws and will help regain public confidence. At the same time, &#x201C;the self-regulatory body&#x2019;s workload is likely to be heavy and there is an issue of whether it can secure enough staff with expertise in crypto exchange business,&#x201D; she told Reuters. In an effort to strengthen the country&#x2019;s digital currencies industry, where more than 160 companies have expressed interest in operating, the FSA on Wednesday published a set of guidelines for those applying to run cryptocurrency exchanges. According to local&#xA0;Japanese media, JVCEA, which has also proposed a 4x limit on margin trading with cryptocurrencies, is likely to implement measures that will set a ceiling on the amount of digital currencies that can be managed online in hot wallets. That ceiling is likely to be capped at 20 percent of customer deposits in the wake of recent hacks, reports say. What do you think about self-regulation in the cryptocurrency industry?

Since then, developers have created a faucet, block explorer, a script install, side-shift transfers, transaction replays, and another chain that resembles the Bitcoin Cash network. Also read: BCH Devcon Streamlines Bitcoin Innovation in San Francisco Developers Build Tools to Make Drivechain Projects Easier Over the last few weeks, a team of programmers has been working with the Bitcoin developer Paul Sztorc since he released the first version of Drivechain. The Drivechain model is essentially a sidechain, but unlike the Liquid sidechain that uses a federation of exchange participants for consensus, the Drivechain security model uses a miner-based escrow system. Andreas Brekken has built a lot of extension programs for Drivechain. Brekken tells news.Bitcoin.com there&#x2019;s still a lot of work to be done, and he is learning a lot himself. Since the Drivechain project launch, the protocol has seen a lot of development, a slew of new features, and extension applications. Developers from all types of blockchain projects have been working with Sztorc on the official Github repository and a Drivechain Telegram channel. For instance, the programmer Andreas Brekken, the infamous guy who once controlled the largest node on the Lightning Network, has developed a toolkit for people getting started with Drivechain. &#x201C;The toolkit makes getting started with Drivechain Testdrive easier and more fun,&#x201D; explains Brekken&#x2019;s repository. The Sideshift.ai platform. The toolkit Brekken created has a faucet which disperses free Drivenet coins so users can test the Drivechain system. Then there&#x2019;s a protocol called Sideshift.ai which allows Drivenet coins to be swapped between any chains. For a 1 percent fee, Sideshift will convert a specific sidechain coin to Drivechain mainnet coins without waiting. There&#x2019;s also an auto-installer Brekken created, which automatically installs Drivechain with sidechains on Ubuntu Linux operating systems. Another useful tool is the transaction replayer called &#x2018;Driveby,&#x2019; a protocol that replays BTC transactions on to the main chain. Then there&#x2019;s a set of block explorers for the Drivenet (mainchain), sidechain one, and the payments sidechain. In addition to Brekken&#x2019;s help, many developers have been contributing and discussing the Drivechain project via the group&#x2019;s Telegram channel. Andreas Brekken&#x2019;s Github repository for Drivechain extensions. The &#x2018;Boring&#x2019; Chain and the Competitive Chain Speaking with news.Bitcoin.com, Brekken says that at the moment, the Drivechain project is in earliest testing phase and there are a lot of kinks to iron out before mainnet work can begin. Following the toolkit launch on Oct. 22, Sztorc revealed to his Twitter followers that Drivenet now has two sidechains. &#x201C;Sidechain One, a boring copy of Bitcoin Core, for testing purposes only, and Paychain, a Bitcoin ABC-like chain, to compete with BCH,&#x201D; Sztorc details. &#x201C;ABC describes where the BCH are &#x2014; This sidechain software, &#x2018;Paynet&#x2019;, describes where its paynet-Bitcoin are &#x2014; And it does so following [mostly] the same consensus rules as ABC,&#x201D; Sztorc explains. &#x201C;Basically, it has some edits to support larger blocks.&#x201D; Paul Sztorc. Sztorc also spoke with news.Bitcoin.com regarding the recent development and enthusiasm toward Drivechain. The developer explains he&#x2019;s been pleased with everyone contributing and offering ideas. &#x201C;It has been really great,&#x201D; Sztorc details. &#x201C;I never thought we would have all of this stuff &#x2014; faucet, block explorer, and the &#x2018;Sideshift&#x2019; service &#x2014; so quickly. This software was produced by basically one guy, working from mid-2016 to mid-2018. In that time we&#x2019;ve managed to solve the industry&#x2019;s key problem: consensus disputes. These disputes led to consensus-disabling phenomena such as Altcoins or hard forks. And these disputes are the key driver of the blocksize debate, the extreme polarization and nasty debate, the rise of misguided projects (such as Ethereum and private blockchains).&#x201D; Sztorc further explains that the software allows for an unlimited number of safe, optional, and ignorable blocksize increases. &#x201C;It also makes substantial progress on the &#x2018;Bitcoin&#x2019;s long run hashrate security without inflation&#x2019; problem, and it even makes it easier to run a competitive pool,&#x201D; the Bitcoin developer adds. Sztorc concludes by stating: The only new security assumption is that: what is true of the one popular chain will also be true of a few smaller chains &#x2014; That&#x2019;s almost as good as it gets. The influx of Drivechain development also follows the recent launch of Blockstream&#x2019;s sidechain product, Liquid. However, the sidechain has come under scrutiny for being centralized by quite a few members of the cryptocurrency community. This has sparked a debate over whether or not federated sidechains are better than drivechains that utilize miners for consensus. The Drivechain store. In addition to the group of programmers from both BTC and BCH development camps helping Sztorc with the Drivechain protocol and extensions, there&#x2019;s also a Drivechain &#x2018;propaganda&#x2019; merchandise shop called the Drivechain store. The store is similar to the e-commerce site that sells UASF hats and bottles of water that wield the Liquid logo. The Drivechain store also sells apparel, jewelry, home decor, and accessories for enthusiasts who just might be obsessed with the sidechain protocol.

There are 'standardness' checks that make it frustrating for normal usage, since transactions with non-standard scriptPubKeys won't be relayed. But, non-standard transactions are perfectly valid.\\n* ScriptSigs (Input scripts) are also limited to 10 KB.\\n* P2SH scripts are currently [limited to 520 bytes for some technical reasons](https://github.com/bitcoin/bips/blob/master/bip-0016.mediawiki#520byte_limitation_on_serialized_script_size).\\n\\nRecently there has been some discussion on whether it is appropriate to add new opcodes like OP\\\\_CHECKDATASIG which could in principle be emulated by Script. Ryan X Charles has suggested that the unrolled version of ECDSA algorithm using only Script arithmetic would take around a megabyte of script. This would of course require relaxing the 10 KB limit.\\n\\nBefore this discussion goes much further, I just want to point out that raising script length limits beyond 10 KB opens up new avenues for denial of service (DoS) attacks -- letting malicious actors create blocks that take ages for everyone else to validate, or send a node some transactions that take a long time to *in*validate. I have [recently found a quadratic scaling problem in OP\\\\_CHECKSIG](https://gist.github.com/markblundeberg/c2c88d25d5f34213830e48d459cbfb44) which fortunately does not affect us at the moment due to the 10 KB limit. Basically this would be exploited by using regular OP\\\\_CHECKSIG with OP\\\\_CODESEPARATORs to create a script whose runtime is quadratic in length.\\n\\nIf the script size limit were raised to 1 MB, then it would be possible to make blocks that take an extreme amount of time to verify (like, several minutes even on a multi-core server).\\n\\nIf some restrictions are put in place (such as removing OP\\\\_CODESEPARATOR) then it may be possible to make Script have an asymptotically linear (not quadratic) runtime by having cached checksig digests. Then, it may indeed make sense to remove the limit on Script length.\", 'https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9qu189/to_prevent_dos_blocks_script_size_limits_should/', '9qu189', [['u/jtoomim', 10, '2018-10-24 03:59', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/btc/comments/9qu189/to_prevent_dos_blocks_script_size_limits_should/e8c3a5c/', \"In your example script, shouldn't it be OP_CHECKSIG instead of OP_CHECKSIGVERIFY?\\n\\nIf you had a 500 opcode limit instead of a 200 opcode limit, couldn't you do more OP_CHECKSIGs and fewer garbage data pushes? Seems this should allow you to make the attack about 2.5x worse even with the 10k byte limit.

It\\'s understandable that many of the people here come from technology backgrounds and not from traditional finance.  However, the SEC has been around a long time and they have very structured rules and regulations about what a security can and cannot do.  So let\\'s lay down some laws and truths, ok?\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Approved vs. Compliant**\\n\\n1. The SEC regulates securities (among other things).  It doesn\\'t matter if they are physicial stocks or digital tokens. The regulations apply to all securities equally.\\n2. The SEC is not an \"approval\" body.  They are a commission -- hence the C in SEC.\\n3. To do business in the United States, a company issuing a security (in this case Nexo issuing NEXO ERC20 tokens) must adhere to the long established rules and regulations handed down by the SEC.  They\\'ve been doing this since 1934.\\n4. No security is \"SEC approved\" -- there are only either SEC compliant or non-compliant securities on the market.\\n5. The SEC will -- after a company performs and action or makes a distribution, determine if the result was either compliant or non-compliant with their rules and regulations.  If compliant, you never hear from them. If not compliant, they determine the scale of action, impact to the security holders, the intent behind the non-compliance, and have a discussion with the company.\\n6. The SEC right now is concerned with outright fraud, fake ICOs, and other wildfires in this space.  NEXO is not one of these and NEXO is playing by the rules so far, so we are in the clear, unless they\\'re not disclosing something.\\n7. So the takeaway from this section is: The SEC doesn\\'t \"approve\" or \"disapprove\" a security.  Period.  They tell if what you\\'re doing is on the up-and-up or against the law, then they take appropriate action.  You don\\'t go to them for permission first like you ask Mom and Dad to go on a field trip.  You just go on the field trip and follow the rules from school without a permission slip.  But if you get into a fist fight next to the merry-go-round, there are consequences and your parents might whip yo\\' ass when you get home and ground you for a month.  Good analogy?\\n\\n**Paying Dividends**\\n\\n1. Nexo has a legal team -- and competent one at that. They\\'re reading all the rules and regulations from the SEC and trying to follow them as they (NEXO legal advisors/team) interprets them.  That is a good faith effort and that will always land you in the good graces of the SEC.\\n2. NEXO can\\'t simply pay a dividend at random.  There are specific rules and regulations a company must follow to pay a dividend.\\n3. NEXO has to establish what is called an \"ex-dividend\" date. This is a date when the balance of the NEXO holders will be counted for the purposes of dividend distribution.\\n4. According to the NEXO Medium post they have done the above. It is ten days prior to the dividend distribution date.  We now know the distribution date is December 15, 2018 so the ex-dividend date in this case is December 5th, 2018.\\n5. Your coins must be in the NEXO wallet, on the NEXO platform, **on the ex-dividend date**.  If you put them in on December 10th, you\\'re not getting dividends on those tokens. Period.\\n6. There is no argument here. These are SEC rules and NEXO not adhering to them would put them out of compliance and that wouldn\\'t be a good thing.  Dad is gonna get home from work and whip \\'yo ass for not following the rules. Their Medium post shows they understand the rules and they\\'re following them.  This is very good.\\n\\n**Calculating Dividends, Showing Loans, Disclosing Profits**\\n\\n1. In order for a company to state they\\'re paying \"30% of net profits\" you can\\'t just make up a number and start giving a dividend.  All companies have to show proof.  This has been a rule since your parents were in school.  You have to show your income, losses, expenses, and profit to everyone to see.  Then you can use that number to calculate the dividends.  Not doing this puts a company out of compliance with the SEC rules and regulations == ass whippin\\'\\n2. Given all of the above, and their own Medium posts, we will likely hear from NEXO about a week prior to December 5th, with their official numbers and official notification that ex-dividend date is happening on Dec 5th, with distribution on Dec 15th.  This is good for all of us, because we\\'ll see exactly what we\\'re getting and know their numbers.  They must disclose.  \\n3. We also now know that the tokens must be in 10 days before the distribution -- so they have time to calculate and organize the payout.  This is standard operating procedure for any dividend paid on any security -- traditional bank/finance or crypro token. Doesn\\'t matter.\\n4. I understand that can all sound like FUD or whatever you want it call it.  It doesn\\'t matter what YOU call it, because the SEC calls it the rules and regulations that have been in effect for almost 85 years, ever since companies started paying dividends.  \\n5. Simple formula:  If you do things a security does, you\\'re under the jurisdiction of the SEC in the USA. That makes you security whether you like it or not.  That means you have to follow the established 85 year old rules.  You follow the rules or you\\'re grounded until you do, or forever, depending on the intent and magnitude of offense.  See #6 in first section: \"The SEC right now is concerned with outright fraud, fake ICOs, and other wildfires in this space.  NEXO is not one of these and NEXO is playing by the rules so far, so we are in the clear, unless they\\'re not disclosing something.\"\\n\\nNEXO has done everything good here.  They\\'ve filed the paperwork and continue to put forth effort to remain compliant as their legal council interprets the SEC rules and regulations.  Notice how that is worded.  Back to the statement of nothing is \"approved\" by the SEC, yet you certainly can get into trouble for not following their laws and being compliant. The SEC has been quiet on crypto specifically, but they have been very, very public that **just because we\\'re talking tokens doesn\\'t mean the rules change.**\\n\\nI have long term faith in NEXO.  It\\'s my second biggest holding next to BTC.  I\\'ve used their platform a dozen times and it\\'s amazing.  I expect a decent dividend.  They are doing everything right.  Their articles speak to all of the above, just not in the flat out words I am using but they have addressed the ex-dividend information.  Specifically:\\n\\n&gt;*\"* ***2. NEXO Tokens must be held/staked in your Nexo Wallets at the*** [***ex-dividend date***](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ex-dividend_date)*,  which is 10 days prior to the dividend distribution date. The first  ex-dividen...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nOn Dec. 4, 2017, I authored the first of what would turn out to be many articles highlighting Geron Corporation 's (NASDAQ: GERN) rather compelling risk-to-reward ratio for potential investors. At the time, the stock was trading under $1.90 a share. Not long afterwards, I would go on to add Geron to my personal biotech portfolio. The core reason was that this stock appeared to me to be grossly undervalued at the time -- that is, relative to imetelstat's healthy commercial prospects in the high-value blood cancer space. The drug's clinical program, after all, was being handled by none other than Johnson & Johnson (NYSE: JNJ) and the blood cancer market is among the fastest growing in all of healthcare. A boy in a gray shirt and wearing glasses appearing to be shocked and excited while looking at a tablet. Image source: Getty Images. And as luck would have it, this pick turned out to be a big winner for me. Since my first bullish article on Geron nearly 10 months ago, the stock has appreciated by a handsome 220% as I write this. But with J&J set to update investors on its vast pharmaceutical business in less than two days , I think it's high time for another critical assessment, one that's decidedly more sober than the ones being floated on social media at the moment. Is Geron's stock still a buy? Like most of my fellow shareholders, I found J&J's recent job posting naming imetelstat in the description to be a reassuring sign that a positive continuation decision is forthcoming. However, I do not agree with some of the more optimistic souls out there that a positive continuation decision will be a major market-moving event for Geron. Here's why. Imetelstat -- contrary to a growing belief among some bulls on social media -- is probably more than two full years away from being approved. The first leg of the IMerge trial evaluating imetelstat in patients with the devastating bone marrow disorder myelodysplastic syndromes was never designed to permit a regulatory filing. And the same can be said for the drug's other trial for advanced myelofibrosis known as IMbark. Story continues The point is that the most likely outcome is J&J advancing imetelstat into one or more registration worthy trials, upon picking up the drug's option. And that doesn't bode well for Geron's near-term valuation. As I've mentioned before , imetelstat's net present valuation for its first two lead indications combined is somewhere around $1.5 billion. Geron's market cap is now north of $1.1 billion. Geron's market cap, therefore, may have trouble topping the $1.5 billion mark without being acquired by its partner. J&J, after all, will retain the lion's share of imetelstat's revenue, if approved. So, what about a buyout? I personally don't think a buyout is in the cards anytime soon. Because additional late-stage studies will probably be necessary, Geron would have to be willing to sell out at a marked discount, relative to the drug's commercial potential, to get a deal done at this point. With an aging CEO at the helm, Geron might choose to go this path, but a deal won't be shareholder-friendly at this stage of development. What's next? As everyone knows, J&J must hand down a decision on imetelstat's clinical program before Sept. 30. Although I do think the chances of a negative outcome are dwindling by the day, I also happen to think that this stock is nearing a top. To be frank, this recent run-up is almost certainly being driven by speculators looking for a quick buck. As a direct consequence, this stock could easily slip back to the $5 level if J&J announces nothing more than a continuation of imetelstat's clinical development. That's the harsh reality of clinical-stage biotech stocks in this day and age of instant gratification. I'd caution against buying at these levels, unless you're willing to hold this stock for an extended period of time.

Projections released by the central bank show median rates of 5.6% before years end, up from the current range of 5.25% to 5.5%. The suggested hike garnered support from 12 Federal Reserve officials and opposition from 9. Fed Projections (September vs June) We want to see convincing evidence really that we have reached the appropriate level, and were seeing progress, and we welcome that, Fed chair Jerome Powell told reporters at a press conference following the decision. But, you know, we need to see more progress before well be willing to reach that conclusion. According to CoinMarketCap, $30B was wiped from the combined capitalization of crypto assets, which now sits at $1.05T following the 3% retracement. BTC has since dropped 2.5%, and ETH is down 3% after both assets regained 1% in the past 24 hours. Quarterly Options Set To Expire Septembers close will also coincide with the expiry of $3B worth of quarterly BTC options and $1.8B in contracts tracking Ether. Luuk Strijers, the chief commercial officer at crypto options exchange Deribit, told The Defiant that quarterly contracts are typically the most significant in terms of volume and value, estimating institutions represent 85% of activity. However, Strijers said he does not expect to see strong market moves in the coming week based on the current positioning of market participants. On-chain Activity Drops September has been the weakest month for Ethereums on-chain activity this year. According to Ultra Sound Money, more than 13,000 ETH ($21M) was added to Ethers supply since the month began  meaning Ethereums burn mechanism failed to offset new ETH entering supply as rewards for validators amid the slump in activity. ETH Supply Change The low activity has been attributed to the prolonged downturn in the NFT market and the buzz surrounding memecoins dying down. Story continues However, the retracement in on-chain also coincides with Layer 2 transaction throughput setting new highs multiple times in recent weeks.

If you want to skip our detailed analysis of the cryptocurrency market, you can go directly to see 5 Most Searched Cryptocurrencies in 2023 . The Cryptocurrency Market Boom Cryptocurrency is a founding stone that brought the evolution of blockchain technology and then led to the emergence of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), Web3, and the metaverse. A big milestone for the cryptocurrency market was achieved when Bitcoin (BTC) touched the $1,000 mark on November 27, 2013. Earlier in 2013, Bitcoin (BTC) was added as a word to the Oxford English Dictionary, which defined Bitcoin as “a digital currency in which transactions can be performed without the need for a central bank.” Bitcoin (BTC) started to get wider recognition worldwide when the price of BTC almost touched $20,000 in December 2017. The 2017 cryptocurrency market boom changed everything in the world of digital currency. The crypto bull market started in May 2017, when Bitcoin’s price soared over $2,000 for the first time and crossed $3,000 just a few weeks later. At that time, the market forces also showed subsequent turbulence, including BTC’s price dropping by $300 within one hour of the trading session on June 12, 2017. However, the market forces kept the Bitcoin price on the rise. Perhaps one of the major developments was the Wall Street analysts entering the BTC price analysis game. Goldman Sachs analyst Sheba Jafari predicted Bitcoin to cross $3,600 which further led to forecasts from other notable analysts. Bitcoin reached the $20,000 price mark on December 17, 2017, making history in the cryptocurrency market. A few days later, a drop of 30% wiped off billions of dollars from the total cryptocurrency market capitalization, making it one of the biggest market corrections in history. Since then, cryptocurrency has been a highly volatile market with massive pumps and dumps, subsequently. Story continues Crypto Market Outlook If we look at the one-year movement of Bitcoin (BTC), the crypto deity is following an upward trend. The crypto market follows the trend of Bitcoin as it still leads the market sentiment. On August 25, Bloomberg reported that JPMorgan Chase & Co. (NYSE:JPM) analyst Nikolaos Panigirtzoglou mentioned that there is some positive sentiment building around the crypto market based on open interest in CME Bitcoin futures contracts. Based on that, Panigirtzoglou believes that there is a limited downside for crypto markets over the near term. Bitcoin (BTC) continues to trade at about 60% above since the start of 2023, surpassing other well-performing assets like technology stocks . Bitcoin (BTC) is trading at around the $26,700 price mark, as of 6:23 a.m. Eastern Time on September 21. At the same time, BTC is almost up by 40% over the last 12 months. Ethereum (ETH), the second largest crypto asset, is trading at $1,608, up by 20% over the last 12 months. The total cryptocurrency market capitalization on coinmarketcap.com stands at $1.06 trillion, with Bitcoin’s dominance of 49.2% and Ethereum’s dominance of 18.3%, at the time of writing on September 21. The cryptocurrency market has continuously grown despite the regulatory and market upheavals. Crypto is getting more adoption with its existence in the NFTs, Web3, and the metaverse. According to a study from IMARC Group , the global cryptocurrency market size touched $2 trillion in 2022 and it is expected to reach $4 trillion by 2028, growing at a compound annual growth rate of 11.7% between 2023 and 2028. Cryptocurrency for Businesses Today, cryptocurrencies are widely used for business and merchant payments. According to Deloitte , 2,353 U.S. businesses accept Bitcoin, as per an estimate in late 2022. That excludes the use of Bitcoin ATMs. Global companies are also accepting the use of Bitcoin and other top currencies for investment, operational, and transactional purposes. Some of the leading companies that accept Bitcoin (BTC) and other crypto assets include PayPal Holdings, Inc. (NASDAQ:PYPL), Visa Inc. (NYSE:V), Mastercard Incorporated (NYSE:MA), and Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) - to name a few. For instance, Elon Musk has an immense involvement in the crypto market. Musk has been a great admirer of cryptocurrencies and his companies hold a large portion of Bitcoins. As of the second quarter of 2023, Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) held digital assets worth $184 billion, which has remained the same for the past three quarters. Apart from that, the world’s largest asset management firm BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) has filed for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF) to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC). The SEC has delayed the ruling until the start of 2024. If BlackRock, Inc. (NYSE:BLK) gets the regulatory approval for a Bitcoin spot exchange-traded fund (ETF), it will become the first company to hold the first crypto spot ETF in the U.S. The crypto industry has created new spaces for companies to enter the market such as crypto exchanges, exchange-traded funds (ETFs), crypto mining, crypto wallets, crypto lending, smart contract platforms, and crypto ATMs, among others. Cryptocurrency exchanges have played a great role in taking digital assets to the masses, helped by crypto payment platforms.

Initially, it was suspected that PayPal was behind the transaction, but Paxos stated that the problem was their own.\nPaxos made the error on September 10 when it overpaid the Bitcoin network fee. However, the business assured customers that the event only affected Paxos' corporate operations and that customer payments were safe and not impacted.\nThe transaction came to light when blockchain data revealed that fees of approximately 20 BTC (over $515,000 at the time) were paid for a transfer of just 0.07 BTC (worth less than $2,000).\nBitcoin enthusiast Mononaut had suggested that PayPal might be involved, pointing out similarities between the sending account and an inactive wallet labeled \"Paypal\" by analytics platform OXT. However, Paxos' statement clarified that PayPal was not responsible for the transaction.\nPaxos is now working with the mining company to rectify the situation and recover the excess fees paid.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":26067.09,\"take_profit\":27091.69,\"forecast_10d\":[26298.48, 26217.25, 26352.72, 27021.55, 26911.72, 26967.92, 27983.75, 27530.79, 27429.98, 27799.39]}"}

The exceptions were Cardano and Toncoin, which both posted minor losses. Ether logged moderate gains but remained below US$1,650. U.S. financial services giant JPMorgan Chase & Co. is reportedly exploring a blockchain-based payment and settlement system, raising optimism for more institutional adoption of blockchain. U.S. stock futures traded mixed, after the S&P 500 and Nasdaq closed lower on Thursday. Stronger-than-expected jobs data has added to U.S. rate hike concerns.\nBitcoin rose 1.62% in the last 24 hours to US$26,179.43 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, turning a weekly loss into a gain of 0.75%, according toCoinMarketCapdata. The world’s leading cryptocurrency had been trading between around US$25,500 and US$26,000 since Saturday. It reached an eight-day high of US$26,409.30 early Friday morning.\nJPMorgan, the largest bank in the U.S. by asset size, is “in the early stage” of developing a blockchain-based digital deposit token for cross-border payments and settlements. The bank has already laid out most of the underlying infrastructure, but will wait for approval from U.S. regulators before making the token itself, BloombergreportedFriday.\nDeposit tokens are transferable digital assets representing deposit claims against a commercial bank. Token transactions take place on blockchains, making deposits faster and cheaper than traditional methods.\n“It is another sign that large corporations continue to build their blockchain capabilities during this bear market,” Markus Thielen, head of research & strategy at digital asset service platform Matrixport, said in an emailed comment.\n“When it comes to crypto, some traditional players are holding back while others are making strides,” said Justin d’Anethan, head of Asia-Pacific business development at Belgium-based crypto market maker Keyrock. PayPal’sannouncementthat it will launch a stablecoin has started a domino effect of institutional action in crypto, he said.\n“Once a large player kicks things off and competitors see that as a desirable/profitable set-up, it won’t be long until other players launch their own solution, if only to stay relevant in an ever-advancing space,” d’Anethan added.\nThe market is currently waiting on a decision from the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) regarding another U.S. financial giant — BlackRock. On June 15, the world’s top asset managerappliedfor approval to create a spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF).\n“While most expect the SEC Blackrock decision to hit the market in October, the news of a potential ETF approval can also come any time,” Thielen said.\n“Once Bitcoin regains some momentum, the rally could have legs and bring prices back above US$30,000,” he added.\nElsewhere, Martin Gruenberg, chairman of the U.S. Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC),saidon Thursday that despite the apparent good health of the U.S. economy, the country’s banking industry “continues to face significant downside risks from the effects of inflation, rising market interest rates, and geopolitical uncertainty.”\nBitcoin prices havehistoricallybenefited from uncertainties in the banking system, such as the crisis at Zurich-based lender Credit Suisse in March. The bank’s sudden collapsesentthe token’s price from below US$27,000 to over US$28,000 on March 19.\nEthereum gained 0.77% to US$1,644.68 over the past 24 hours and edged down 0.07% for the past seven days.\nMost other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies logged small gains. Cardano’s ADA and the TON network’s Toncoin were the only tokens that posted losses, dipping 0.14% and 0.70% respectively. But both coins posted gains for the week at 1.07% for ADA and 3.68% for Toncoin.\nThe total crypto market capitalization gained 1.37% to US$1.05 trillion. Trading volume dropped 11.95% to US$23.81 billion.\nU.S. stock futures were trading mixed as of 09:40 a.m. in Asia. The three major U.S. indexes also closed mixed on Thursday, with the Nasdaq Composite posting a 0.89% loss. All the main Asian indexes were down Thursday morning, with Hong Kong’s Hang Seng leading the losses with a 1.34% drop.\nInitial jobless claims in the U.S.fellto 216,000 for the week ending Sept. 2, the lowest level since February. That was short of the 234,000forecastby experts in a Reuters poll.\nLast week’s August jobs data pointed to agradual softeningin the U.S. labor market. But Thursday’s jobless report shows “the labor market is still tight,” Nancy Vanden Houten, lead U.S. economist at Oxford Economics, toldBloomberg. She said the data could influence the U.S. Federal Reserve’s thinking on interest rates,\n“More moderation in job growth will be needed to keep rate hikes further down the road off the table,” Vanden Houten said.\nOn the other side, multiple Federal Reserve officialssaidon Thursday they thought the U.S. central bank should keep interest rates unchanged at its meeting on Sept. 20. In July, the Fed raised the rate to between 5.25% and 5.50% — the highest level in the past 22 years.\n“I’m not yet convinced that we’ve extinguished excess inflation. But in today’s complex economic environment, returning inflation to 2 percent will require a carefully calibrated approach—not endless buckets of cold water,” Lorie Logan, president of the Federal Reserve Bank of Dallassaidon Thursday.\nLogan said that another rate hike pause would be “appropriate” when the Fed meets again later this month.\nTheCME FedWatch Toolpredicts a 95% chance the central bank will maintain the current rate unchanged in September, up from 93% on Thursday. It gives a 57.4% chance for another pause in November.\nMeanwhile, multiple Chinese government agencies haveinstructedtheir staff not to bring iPhones to work amid tensions between Beijing and Washington.

Bitcoin Price at 2011 Levels Returns as Bitcoin BSC Coin Launch Provides Chance to Earn Free Bitcoin Clone Tokens Bitcoin , the world's leading cryptocurrency , is struggling right now after bulls were trapped as enthusiasm at the prospect of the SEC spot bitcoin ETFs getting speedy approval receded. The price retraced below the $26k level, but it has been a different story for Bitcoin clone derivative coins. During the past three months, for example, the Bitcoin Cash (BCH) fork from Bitcoin is up 73%, while Bitcoin has fallen -2.3% in the same time period. Meanwhile, a similar staking-based bitcoin derivative coin to Bitcoin BSC, BTC20 , which launched a month ago, is up 52%. In fact, BTC20 hit an all-time (ATH) intraday high of $6 , equating to a 688% 7x gain on its $1 presale and listing price. Yet another bitcoin clone derivative, this time BTC2.0, rose to an ATH of $1.06 to register a return of 538x, although the price has retraced markedly from its peak. Earn free Bitcoin clone tokens with stake-to-earn Bitcoin BSC coin Bitcoin BSC aims to match, or beat, the success of all of these Bitcoin clone coins, and to achieve that end it has a not-so-secret weapon – staking. While the performance of BTC2.0, not to be confused with BTC20, since its heights has been somewhat underwhelming, there has been more of a steady-as-she-goes approach by the likes of BTC20. That's probably largely down to the ballast effect of staking, which bears down on any selling pressure that may emerge at listing. In this way, Bitcoin BSC seeks to emulate BTC20 by adopting a similar design and strategy, providing the price with a stable platform for takeoff. Like BTC20, Bitcoin BSC has staking utility built into its design from the outset. However, it should be noted that there is one important difference between Bitcoin BSC and BTC20 – Bitcoin BSC is a BEP-20 BNB Smart Chain-compliant token, and BTC20 is an ERC-20 Ethereum -compliant token – hence the BSC in the name. Story continues Staking has been popular in the crypto DeFi space, but enthusiasm waned in the aftermath of high-profile implosions of staking ecosystems such as Terra Luna . However, the attractiveness of transparent staking that has a clearly defined source of yield, unlike the opaque algorithms in use on Terra Luna , has not gone away. With $BTCBSC, which runs on the BNB Smart Chain, the yield is paid out over a 120-year period, in line with Bitcoin block confirmations. Altogether, 69% of the total token supply is allocated to distribute as rewards. Staking provides token holders with a way of earning token rewards in proportion to how many coins of the total pool they deposit into a staking smart contract and the time they choose to stake for. It is this staking feature that will deliver price support while offering both positive capital returns and income yield to network participants. Bitcoin BSC staking is operative now, even before the coin lists on the decentralized exchange PancakeSwap. You can keep an eye on how many token holders are staking by visiting the real-time Bitcoin BSC staking dashboard . Also, keep up-to-date with all project developments on X (formerly Twitter) and the Telegram channel . You can snap up Bitcoin BSC at the low Bitcoin 2011 price of $0.99 $BTCBSC can be bought today for $ 0.99 – the same price the Bitcoin was at back in its 2011 early days, and a far cry from the $25,7000 it will cost you to purchase Bitcoin at today's prices. Bitcoin BSC's comparatively low price means contributors to the presale could be sitting on substantial upside potential when the Bitcoin halving bull run takes off. The four-yearly event that sees block rewards halved on the original Bitcoin network has previously ushered in mind-melting bull runs. This halving is expected to have the effect of lifting all boats – especially the prices of quality Bitcoin clone derivative coins such as $BTCBSC. Bitcoin BSC has the same total token supply as Bitcoin – 21 million. Of that total supply, 29% is up for grabs through the presale of 6,125,000 tokens, meaning BTCBSC has an initial market cap of $6,063,750 . Two percent of the supply is reserved for DEX liquidity provision to guarantee smooth trading at launch and beyond. The remaining 14,455,000 BTCBSC tokens (69% of supply) is reserved for staking rewards, which are paid out every 10 minutes as new blocks are added to the chain. At that token emission rate, the maximum supply will be reached in about 120 years – the same time frame as Bitcoin . Presale and post-presale investors can buy and stake tokens at any time with a 7-day lock on withdrawals. Bear in mind that because BTCBSC runs on the BNB Smart Chain, to buy and stake in the presale, you will need to use BNB for your purchase. However, those buying with ETH today can start staking after the presale ends. https://twitter.com/Bitcoinbsctoken/status/1698803185727521146 Faster, cheaper, more powerful and expandable than other Bitcoin clones Still, staking is not the only advantage BTCBSC has over Bitcoin and the larger-cap clone coins such as Bitcoin Cash, and Bitcoin SV. For one thing, $BTCBSC uses a proof-of-stake protocol, which means it runs on a much more scalable blockchain that is also cheaper and more efficient to transact on. Because BTCBSC is built on the BNB Smart Chain, transaction fees are less than $0.10 , compared to around $10 on Bitcoin and approximately $20 on Ethereum , depending on network conditions. Another advantage BTCBSC has is its fast transaction speeds, which are typically less than 5 seconds compared to 10 minutes for Bitcoin , BCH, and BSV. BNB Smart Chain is capable of running applications, too, so there's no limit to future development possibilities for Bitcoin BSC. Bitcoin BSC has a lot going for it, and with only $3,960,000 being raised in the presale, demand is sure to be robust. Crypto market prices are generally becalmed, but there are waters where the current is much healthier. In the Bitcoin derivative clone sector, there's all to play for as far as bagging out 10x gains goes. Get in early, and the rewards will not just accrue to long-term stakers earning a generous APY, but also to those who want the chance to access life-changing returns.

(BZX) filed a proposed rule change with the SEC to allow it to list and trade shares of the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust in 2016. This first application for a Bitcoin ETF by the Winklevoss twins’ was rejected by the SEC in March 2017. The stated reason being the largely unregulated nature of Bitcoin (BTC) markets. The agency said then:\\n\\n”When the spot market is unregulated--there must be significant, regulated derivatives markets related to the underlying asset with which the Exchange can enter into a surveillance-sharing agreement.”\\n\\nFollowing the disapproval of the initial proposition, the group filed “a timely petition seeking Commission review of the disapproval by delegated authority.”\\nThe SEC published a new release Thursday, July 26, rejecting the petition. Regarding the Winklevoss’ claim that crypto markets are “uniquely resistant to manipulation,” the agency said that “the record before the Commission does not support such a conclusion.”\\nThe SEC further emphasized that their rejection of the petition did not hinge on whether cryptocurrencies or blockchain technology “[have] utility or value as an innovation or an investment.” The Commission continued:\\n\\n“Rather, the Commission is disapproving this proposed rule change because... BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission’s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act... in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices.”\\n\\nThe Commission stated its concern that a significant portion of Bitcoin trading happens on “unregulated exchanges outside the United States,” in addition to qualms over low liquidity.\\nDespite receiving requests for a Bitcoin ETF approval from a number of applicants, the SEC has still not accepted any of them as of press time.\\n'], [18240, 'south-korea-s-financial-watchdog-urges-lawmakers-to-move-forward-with-crypto-bill', 16245, 'South Korea’s Financial Watchdog Urges Lawmakers to Move Forward With Crypto Bill', '2018-07-26 19:30:00', 'South Korea’s Financial Services Commission has urged lawmakers to hasten their approval of the country’s first cryptocurrency bill, in light of recent exchange hacks.', 'South Korean watchdog the Financial Services Commission (FSC) has urged lawmakers to hasten their approval of the country’s first cryptocurrency bill, Bloomberg reports July 26.\\xa0 \\xa0\\nHong Seong-ki, head of the FSC’s virtual currency response team, has reportedly warned of the security and money laundering risks courted by the country’s domestic crypto exchanges.

We’re trying to legislate the most urgent and important things first, aiming for money-laundering prevention [AML] and investor protection. The bill should be passed as soon as possible.”\\n\\nIn May, the FSC joined a probe that was initiated by Korea’s Financial Supervisory Service (FSS) into anti-money laundering (AML) compliance among exchanges. The impetus for Seoul to formalize regulators’ oversight has likely been reinforced by two recent high-profile exchange hacks.\\nBloomberg notes that a draft bill introduced by Korea’s ruling party in March would bring exchanges under the direct aegis of the FSC, but still requires approval by the National Assembly.\\nSeong-ki is further quoted as saying that if the bill is passed, the FSC’s oversight would not imply “an official endorsement of crypto trading,” but would allow the watchdog to “police” exchanges’ operations effectively, rather than in any way “promote their growth.”\\nEarlier this month, Cointelegraph reported on plans for an extraordinary session of the Assembly to be held July 13 to 26 for lawmakers to further review draft regulations for cryptocurrencies, Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) and blockchain.\\nMeanwhile, three Korean ministries are said to be working to produce the final draft of a new blockchain industry classification scheme by the end of the month. The draft could potentially redefine the status of crypto exchanges and recognize them as regulated financial institutions, as opposed to their previous classification as “communication vendors.”\\nThis is arguably a pivotal moment in which Seoul is reviewing its stance towards crypto and blockchain, with fresh news that the government has pledged to introduce friendly blockchain investment legislation, as well as indications this spring that it plans to reverse its blanket ban on domestic ICOs.\\n'], [18239, 'bitcoin-waiting-for-reasons-to-go-higher-says-blockchain-vc-partner-spencer-bogart', 26863, 'Bitcoin ‘Waiting for Reasons to Go Higher’, Says Blockchain VC Partner Spencer Bogart', '2018-07-26 18:45:00', 'Optimism on Bitcoin’s price has spread to blockchain VC partner Spencer Bogart, who delivered a bullish forecast to CNBC.', 'Blockchain Capital partner Spencer Bogart compared Bitcoin (BTC) to a “tinderbox” July 26, telling CNBC prices could grow further due to multiple “catalysts.”\\nSpeaking to CNBC’s Fast Money, Bogart, who is regular commentator on the network and on cryptocurrency social media, adopted a notably bullish tone compared to just weeks ago when Bitcoin was trading around $6,000.\\n“Any number of catalysts could send bitcoin exploding higher,” he forecast, adding:\\n\\n“Bitcoin is kind of a tinderbox right now, waiting for reasons to go higher.”\\n\\nBogart’s increasing optimism adds to a popular narrative in the cryptocurrency industry that has grown out of Bitcoin’s sudden price increase of over 33 percent this month, the majority of which occurred over the past ten days.\\nAt press time Thursday, BTC/USD traded around $8,233 according to Cointelegraph’s price index.\\nLike many commentators, Bogart highlighted potential regulatory approval of a Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF), geopolitical and macroeconomic “tensions” and continued interest in blockchain integration for payments from big business such as MasterCard in July.\\nDespite consensus building that the ETF approval will have to wait until September or even longer, Bogart said the status quo could not continue infinitely.\\n“The cat’s out of the bag,” he continued to CNBC reporters, “[i]nnovation is going elsewhere if the SEC [U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission] doesn’t get on board soon.”\\n'], [18236, 'iran-preparing-ground-for-national-cryptocurrency-to-dodge-us-sanctions', 22349, 'Iran ‘Preparing Ground’ for National Cryptocurrency to Dodge US Sanctions', '2018-07-26 15:35:00', 'Iranian authorities are taking fresh steps towards creating a national cryptocurrency in the face of U.S. sanctions returning.', 'Iran has confirmed it will press ahead with creating its own state-issued cryptocurrency to circumvent incoming U.S.. sanctions, local media Press TV reported July 25.\\nQuoted by local news media outlet ISNA and translated by PressTV, Alireza Daliri, deputy for management and investment at the Directorate for Scientific and Technological Affairs, said plans for the creation of a working digital currency were already on its agenda.\\n“We are trying to prepare the grounds to use a domestic digital currency in the country,” Daliri told ISNA, continuing:\\n\\n“This currency would facilitate the transfer of money (to and from) anywhere in the world.

Mr. Chervinsky asserts that &#x201C;The timing of the ETF approval process follows a standard formula: the ETF files a &#x201C;proposed rule change&#x201D; with the SEC; the SEC posts notice of the filing in the Federal Register and solicits comments; and the SEC has 45 days from posting to approve or deny the ETF,&#x201D; adding that &#x201C;the SEC doesn&#x2019;t have to decide within 45 days. It can extend the deadline up to three times: 45 more days if &#x2018;a longer period is appropriate&#x2019;; 90 more days for the ETF to address grounds for disapproval; and 60 more days if again &#x2018;a longer period is appropriate&#x2019;. This means the real deadline for the SEC to approve or deny an ETF is 240 days after it files notice in the Federal Register.&#x201D; Given the SEC&#x2019;s potential extensions and adjusting for weekend deadlines, Mr. Chervinsky predicts that the final deadline for the &#x201C;Vaneck/Solid X ETF [&#x2026;] should be March 4, 2019.&#x201D; Bitmex Sets Record of Over 1 Million XBT Traded in 24 Hours On the 25th of July, Bitmex, a high leverage bitcoin derivative trading platform based in Seychelles, announced that its traders had set a new record for the number of XBT contracts traded in 24 hours.

SEC Release No. 34-83723, File No. SR-BatsBZX-2016-30 formally denied the Winklevoss Bitcoin Trust ability to list and trade shares. The decision comes amidst high levels of optimism toward bitcoin ETF approval as soon as next month. At least one SEC official does not agree with her colleagues&#8217; decision. Also read: Coinbase Flexes Muscle, Creates Political Action Committee Bitcoin ETF Rejected by SEC, Commissioner Dissents The SEC published its decision to deny a major bitcoin trust the ability to list and trade shares as an ETF. In a 92 page explanation, the US’s primary regulator of such markets rejected a rule change at the behest of Bats BZX Exchange. The proposed change would have allowed bitcoin tethered investment products. Bats BZX finds itself in nearly the exact same position as last year, when it was rejected the first time. On appeal, Bats’ petitioning brought with it robust public commenting in hope of changing the agency&#8217;s mind. Perhaps a positive indication for enthusiasts is how the SEC stipulated to not have prejudice necessarily against cryptocurrencies. Their latest decision places blame on the proposal rather than its particular elements. Though it is rejecting the application and rule change, “the Commission emphasizes that its disapproval does not rest on an evaluation of whether bitcoin, or blockchain technology more generally, has utility or value as an innovation or an investment,” the SEC assured. They’re kicking back the rule change “because, as discussed in detail below, BZX has not met its burden under the Exchange Act and the Commission&#8217;s Rules of Practice to demonstrate that its proposal is consistent with the requirements of the Exchange Act Section 6(b)(5), in particular the requirement that its rules be designed to prevent fraudulent and manipulative acts and practices,&#8221; tantalizingly noting how in time, “regulated bitcoin-related markets may continue to grow and develop.&#8221; Not Everyone at the SEC in Agreement on Latest Bitcoin ETF Rejection ETFs are considered, among cryptosphere cheerleaders for mainstream adoption, something like the holy grail of financial investment products. Exchange traded funds can be listed on legacy boards such as the New York Stock Exchange in much the same way as conventional stocks. The bitcoin variety would likely be a basket of different crypto investments, diversified and relatively low cost like mutual funds. That diversity is believed to be less risky, not to mention saving less crypto savvy investors the trouble of picking which to purchase. And, especially with regard to decentralized digital assets, the complication of holding keys, a wallet, and figuring out custody or storage is all taken care of. Retail investors are very familiar with ETFs. The SEC expanded on its reasoning, explaining how &#8220;existing or newly created bitcoin futures markets may achieve significant size, and an ETP listing exchange may be able to demonstrate in a proposed rule change that it will be able to address the risk of fraud and manipulation by sharing surveillance information with a regulated market of significant size related to bitcoin, as well as, where appropriate, with the spot markets underlying relevant bitcoin derivatives.&#8221; However, not everyone at the SEC was on board with the recent decision to deny bitcoin exchange traded funds. “By precluding approval of cryptocurrency-based ETPs for the foreseeable future, the Commission is engaging in merit regulation,” Commissioner Hester M. Peirce wrote in a published dissent from her colleagues. “Bitcoin is a new phenomenon, and its long-term viability is uncertain. It may succeed; it may fail. The Commission, however, is not well positioned to assess the likelihood of either outcome, for bitcoin or any other asset. Many investors have expressed an interest in gaining exposure to bitcoin, and a subset of these investors would prefer to gain exposure without owning bitcoin directly.” Echoing sentiment among enthusiasts and crypto investors alike, the Commissioner wrote how such a product “based on bitcoin would offer investors indirect exposure to bitcoin through a product that trades on a regulated securities market and in a manner that eliminates some of the frictions and worries of buying and holding bitcoin directly. If we were to approve the ETP at issue here, investors could choose whether to buy it or avoid it. The Commission’s action today deprives investors of this choice. I reject the role of gatekeeper of innovation—a role very different from (and, indeed, inconsistent with) our mission of protecting investors, fostering capital formation, and facilitating fair, orderly, and efficient markets. Accordingly, I dissent,” Commissioner Peirce stressed. What do you think this means for the future of ETFs? Let us know in the comments section below. Images via Pixabay, SEC.

On Sunday, Switzerland goes to the polls on a referendum that will decide if Swiss banks have the right to loan out more money than they actually have in deposits. The fractional reserve banking system, as it is often called, allows the creation of new money out of thin air by loaning out more money than actually exists, and then calling that new money existant. A “Yes” vote would mean the end of fractional reserve banking in Switzerland, with the only institution authorized to create new money being the Swiss National Bank ( OTCMKTS:SWZNF ). A “No” vote would mean status quo and the fractional reserve banking system lives on. Polls are about 54% No and 46% Yes. If this actually passes, the Swiss franc ( CHF-USD ) would skyrocket and the Swiss banking system would go through a severe withdrawal from prolonged liquidity addiction. What to do: If this passes, go long Francs and go short banks like Credit Suisse and UBS. ( NYSE:CS ) ( NYSE:UBS ) SEE: Bitcoin Candy Dispenser Could Facilitate Bitcoin Micropayments ALSO SEE: Japanese Cryptocurrency-Backed Loan Experiment May Change The Course Of Banking ECB Set to Reveal End to Bond Buying Program, Italy Quakes in Boots At the same time that the new big-spending Italian government has been sworn in, promising a universal basic income, higher minimum wage, and other measures that will cost a lot of money that Italy doesn’t have, the European Central Bank has signaled that next week, it will reveal when and how it will finally wind down its massive bond-buying program, which is still going on as we speak. That means the ECB is still handing out newly created money to the Italian government. Once this stops, and speculation is that it will stop come September, Italian rates will likely skyrocket as big spending plans kick off but ECB support is pulled. Things are just heating up in Italy. Wait for the fall. By that we mean the season. Maybe.

Facebook Accused of Selling Data to Chinese Firm Labeled Threat By US Intelligence Facebook ( NASDAQ:FB ) is under fire again for allegedly selling data to Chinese phone maker Huawei, a company labeled a national security threat by US intelligence. Details are sparse but the story hasn’t seemed to cause the same outrage that the Cambridge Analytica scandal did, possibly because Facebook claims it did not upload user data to the Huawei server itself, and has since severed its partnership with the firm. Facebook stock was not affected much either yesterday, shares trading down 0.83% on the day. Lenovo ( OTCMKTS:LNVGY ) was also involved in the faux pas . Is the US About to Take One for the Teamsters? If you want to ship by UPS, do it now rather than later. By August there may be serious delays because United Parcel Service ( NYSE:UPS ) may have a united problem . 280,000 workers under the Teamsters Union have authorized a strike should negotiations with UPS over a new contract break down by the end of July. UPS employs 454,000 people in total. Union workers are worried about how the company will handle possible Sunday deliveries to keep up with eCommerce demands. UPS wants a two-tiered compensation system, but the Teamsters don’t think that’s necessary. What to do: If the Teamsters strike, FedEx ( NYSE:FDX ) would get a major boost, if temporary. GDP could also take a hit, since UPS revenues account for 6% of US GDP. European Union Fires The Next Shot in Ongoing Trade Wars $3.3 billion ammo is accompanying the next volley in the ongoing trade wars between US President Donald Trump and Everybody Else In The World.

Daily Forecast The Bank of Japan is widely expected to leave monetary policy unchanged and reiterate its current aggressive easing stance. This report carries event risk because some analysts believe the BOJ could tweak policy, or suggest that more stimulus was coming in the future. If central bank policymakers are more dovish then expected then the Japanese Yen could weaken. Bloomberg Thoughts “Some 81% of 47 economists surveyed by Bloomberg see the BOJ sticking with its current policy settings at the meeting, while 19% predict additional easing. The meeting comes the day before the Fed is widely expected to cut U.S. interest rates for the first time in more than a decade.” Story continues “While the vast majority of analysts think the BOJ will want to conserve its scarce firepower for now, a key focus will be the BOJ’s stance on future policy. Roughly a third of polled analysts expect the bank to strengthen its pledge to keep rates at extremely low levels at the meeting.” “We think the BOJ will adopt a wait-and-see strategy ahead of the Federal Reserve’s decision on July 31… The BOJ’s latest growth and inflation outlook and any tweaks to its forward guidance will be a focus.” This article was originally posted on FX Empire More From FXEMPIRE: USD/JPY Fundamental Daily Forecast – BOJ Could Adopt ‘Wait and See’ Strategy AUD/USD and NZD/USD Fundamental Daily Forecast – Aussie Dips Slightly on Lower Building Approvals Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 30/07/19 S&P 500 Price Forecast – Stock markets continue to await the Fed NEO Technical Analysis – Support Levels in Play – 30/07/19 Grains Positive Amid Hot Weather Conditions, Ahead of Fed || The Dollar/Yen closed higher on Monday as investors positioned themselves ahead of the release of the Bank of Japan’s monetary policy statement and interest rate decision early Tuesday.

If Libra has to succeed, it has to obtain the necessary approvals from regulators and policymakers, which looks increasingly difficult. With Libra, the adoption and use of cryptocurrencies could have surged due to Facebook’s large user base. Without it there might be a delay, but cryptocurrencies will continue to attract new users to its fold.Analysts are confident that the upcoming halving in Bitcoin in 2020 will be a major confidence booster and will propel the price to new highs. CNBC Squawk Box co-host Joe Kernen is the latest to project a huge upside in Bitcoin. He expects a rally to $55,000 by May 2020, which is an over 450% return from current levels.\\xa0While we are also bullish on Bitcoin and a few other major altcoins, we believe that the best time to buy is when they resume their uptrend. Buying in a downtrend can quickly result in losses and during a downtrend, the news tends to become bearish. Many traders dump their positions out of fear of losing their capital. Hence, it is best to buy when the tide turns in favor of bulls. Let’s see if we can spot any buy setups today.BTC/USDThe bears have not been able to capitalize on the weakness and are finding it difficult to sink Bitcoin (BTC) below the critical support of $9,080. This support has held twice in the past 14 days. The moving averages are also flattening out, which suggests that bears are losing their grip. Now, if bulls can carry the price above the moving averages, it will signal strength. Therefore, we retain our buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis.Contrary to our assumption, if the BTC/USD pair fails to rise above the moving averages, it will indicate selling at higher levels. A breakdown of $9,080 will weaken sentiment and can result in a fall to the next support zone of $7,451.63 to $6,933.90. We expect the pair to make a decisive move within the next few days.ETH/USDEther (ETH) has been hovering around the uptrend line for the past three days. Hence, it becomes important that bulls defend it because if the price plummets below the line with force, it can enter a free fall. There is a minor support at $192.945, but we do not expect it to hold.On the other hand, if the ETH/USD pair rises from the current level and scales above $235.70, it will signal strength. Therefore, we maintain the buy recommendation given in an earlier analysis. This tight range trading is unlikely to continue for long. We expect a large range move in either direction within the next few days.XRP/USDXRP is attempting to bounce from just above $0.30. If bulls can carry the price above the 20-day EMA and $0.34229, it will be a bullish sign. It will also keep the play of the large range between $0.27795 and $0.45 alive. The traders can wait for the price to break out of $0.34229 before initiating long positions. The stop loss can be kept at $0.275. However, as the digital currency tends to spend long periods in consolidation, we suggest traders allocate only 50% of the usual position size to this trade.Contrary to our expectation, if the bounce falters either at the 20-day EMA or at $0.34229, the bears will again attempt to sink the XRP/USD pair below the critical support of $0.27795. If this support breaks down, all bets are off because the decline can then extend to $0.19.\\xa0LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) is stuck between the downtrend line and $83.65. It formed a doji candlestick pattern on July 29, which shows a balance between both buyers and sellers. A break out of the downtrend line will be the first sign of a possible trend change.Conversely, if the LTC/USD pair drops below the $83.65–$76.7143 support zone, it will signal weakness. We expect the bulls to defend $69.9227, which is the 61.8% Fibonacci retracement level of the rally because if this cracks, the decline can extend to $58. The traders can wait for the price to breakout and sustain above the downtrend line before turning positive.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) is attempting to bounce from the uptrend line, which is a positive sign. If bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA and the overhead resistance of $345.80, it will complete an ascending triangle pattern that has a target objective of $440.37. Therefore, traders can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $345.80 and keep a close stop loss of $280.\\xa0Contrary to our assumption, if the BCH/USD pair fails to break out of the overhead resistance and drops below the uptrend line, it can slip to $251.23. A breakdown of this level will signal weakness. We have noticed a large head and shoulders pattern that is forming, hence, we remain cautious on it. However, we will turn bearish only after the pattern completes.\\xa0BNB/USDBinance Coin (BNB) has been gradually moving lower. Its next support is at $24.1709. If the price fails to rebound sharply from this support, it will be a negative sign. A weak bounce will indicate a lack of buyers and will increase the possibility of a drop to $18.30.Conversely, if the BNB/USD pair rebounds from the current levels or from $24.1709 and breaks out of the 50-day SMA, it will indicate strength. We expect the uptrend to resume above $32.60. As the pair is trading close to its lifetime highs, we remain positive on it and will suggest a trade as soon as we spot a bullish setup.EOS/USDWhen buyers do not step in to defend critical support levels, it is usually a bearish sign. EOS continues to trade close to $3.8723, which is an important support. Failure of the price to move above the 20-day EMA shows that bulls are not aggressively buying at these levels.If the EOS/USD pair breaks down of $3.8723, there is a minor support at $3.30, below which the decline can extend to $2.20. The downtrending moving averages and RSI in the negative zone suggest that bears have the upper hand.This bearish view will be invalidated if the pair bounces off the support and rallies above $4.7753. It might face some resistance at the 50-day SMA, but once it is crossed, it is likely to pick up momentum. We do not find any bullish setups at the current levels, hence, we remain neutral on the pair.BSV/USDThe bulls are attempting to keep Bitcoin SV (BSV) in the top half of the descending channel. However, unless they push the price back above the 20-day EMA quickly, bears will once again try to sink the digital currency into the bottom half. With both moving averages trending down and the RSI below 50, the advantage is with the bears.On the downside, the next support is at $107. If this support breaks down, the BSV/USD pair can sink to $61.832, which is the level from where the up move started on May 21.Conversely, if bulls push the price above the resistance line of the descending channel, the pair might either start a new uptrend or consolidate in a range for a few days. We do not find a bullish setup at the current levels, hence we remain neutral in it.\\xa0XLM/USDStellar (XLM) has formed а doji candlestick pattern in the past two days. This shows indecision among both bears and bulls. The price remains stuck between the 20-day EMA and $0.076. On the downside, we anticipate the bulls to defend the $0.072545–$0.076 support zone. However, the digital currency is likely to pick up momentum only after it scales above the 20-day EMA and $0.097795.The downtrending moving averages and RSI in negative territory suggests that bears have the upper hand. If bears sink the XLM/USD pair below $0.072545, it will signal a resumption of the downtrend and will be a huge negative. Due to the uncertainty at current levels, we are not suggesting a trade in it. We will turn bullish if the price sustains above the 20-day EMA.\\xa0ADA/USDCardano (ADA) has been trading inside the symmetrical triangle for the past few days. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout. Therefore, taking positions inside the triangle can lead to losses. The best way is to wait for the breakout before jumping in to buy.Both moving averages are sloping down and the RSI is below 50, which suggests that bears have the upper hand. A breakdown of the triangle will resume the down-move and has a target objective of $0.041.On the other hand, if the ADA/USD pair breaks out of the triangle, it will signal a probable reversal and has a pattern target of $0.079. The rally might face some selling between the 50-day SMA and $0.082, but if this zone is scaled, a retest of $0.10 is likely. Aggressive traders can buy on a breakout and close (UTC time frame) above the triangle and keep a stop loss of $0.056. We recommend keeping the position size only 50% of usual.Market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.\\n'], [29315, 'swiss-crypto-startup-makes-highest-bitcoin-trade-ever-at-4164m', 10230, 'Swiss Crypto Startup Makes ‘Highest’ Bitcoin Trade Ever at 4164m', '2019-07-30 18:46:00', 'Bitcoin Suisse cryptocurrency services company claims to have conducted the highest Bitcoin trade ever, literally.', '\\nCryptocurrency services financial services provider Bitcoin Suisse claims to have conducted a Bitcoin (BTC) trade at the highest altitude ever in a promotional stunt that took place on July 13.

The application is a mobile version of the Openbazaar marketplace, but also includes social media, end-to-end encrypted messaging, and noncustodial wallet services for a variety of digital assets. The following is a review of the Haven application after experimenting with the mobile crypto marketplace first-hand before the public launch. Also Read: Exploring the SLP Token Universe Built on the Bitcoin Cash Chain OB1 Launches the Mobile Platform Haven Privacy The cryptocurrency firm OB1 has launched its second product called Haven, which gives users the ability to access the decentralized Openbazaar network from a smartphone. In addition to the market, the developers have integrated a social media platform that&#x2019;s similar to Twitter, noncustodial crypto wallets, and encrypted chat. The goal of Haven is to &#x201C;keep your data and your financial information safe when you shop, chat, and send cryptocurrencies &#x2014; Using this one-of-a-kind peer-to-peer network means no middlemen or big companies, which means no tracking and no fees,&#x201D; OB1 explained during the launch. The application offers pretty much everything the desktop node version of Openbazaar offers, but it does not allow people to trade digital assets. Currently, the platform supports BCH, ZEC, LTC, and BTC and the company has been questioning the public as to whether ethereum should be added. The new mobile application offers four unique characteristics: Private shopping. Private messaging. Native multi-wallet. Social media. Testing Haven News.Bitcoin.com got access to the Haven application on June 15, so we could test the platform and give our readers the ins and outs of the crypto-based mobile marketplace. Haven is available for Android and iOS and takes about 60MB of space on your mobile phone. In order to start an account, the app asks you for a name which is optional, where you are based, the currency you want to be displayed on the platform, and the optional approval of sharing anonymous analytics with OB1. In order to use digital currencies on Haven, you need a cryptocurrency such as BTC, LTC, BCH, or ZEC. Bitcoin.com offers you the opportunity to purchase bitcoin cash (BCH), bitcoin core (BTC), litecoin (LTC) and other leading coins if you want to purchase goods on the Haven platform. After that information is complete and a quick user agreement is checked, the Haven application is ready to be used. The first thing you probably want to do is secure your account by backing up the backup phrase and editing your profile page. The Haven backup process is the same as writing down a mnemonic seed phrase for a traditional wallet. After writing down the backup, you can proceed to start editing your profile. OB1 founder Brian Hoffman asks the crypto community whether Haven should include ETH. Social Media Like Twitter, the Haven platform is a social media app and you can edit your profile adding a profile picture, cover photo, and a description about yourself in the settings. If you happen to be a vendor, you can highlight your store information as well. Haven allows you to post 280 characters of text, pictures, and URL links as well. The posts are uploaded to a public feed that is divided into &#x201C;most recent&#x201D; and &#x201C;trending.&#x201D; You can like a person&#x2019;s post, repost it (similar to retweet), airdrop the post&#x2019;s link, or respond to it with your own message. Since Haven had a head start in beta testing before the public launch, there&#x2019;s a bunch of users posting on the platform regularly. The profile section itself gives you an overview so you can toggle actions and services like the multi-wallet, a wishlist, notifications for the store and social media, purchase, sales transaction history, and support. The social media aspect of Haven is similar to Twitter and only allows for 280 characters of text. You can also upload photos and link URLs. Posts can be reposted, liked, and you can also respond to them as well. Private Shopping The shopping section is quite large for people who want to spend cryptocurrencies on unique items. You can access this section by tapping the shopping cart at the bottom left of the screen. The marketplace is broken down into categories like electronics, books, games, apparel, sports, vehicles, media, beverages, health and beauty, and a general section that aggregates everything. Haven has a wide array of shopping categories and uploading a product for sale is fairly intuitive, allowing people to customize each store listing. If you choose to view a product being sold on Haven, it will show the picture and the seller&#x2019;s description of the item alongside reviews if there are any. Some Haven sellers have different terms and conditions and return policies. Perusing the platform also shows a great majority of Haven vendors accept all four digital assets, while other dealers accept only one or a few. On top of the general market page, there are featured items shown and highlighted discounts. There are a lot of items for sale on Haven that can be purchased with BCH, LTC, ZEC, and BTC. Many traders accept all four cryptocurrencies. Encrypted Chat The Haven platform also offers an end-to-end encrypted messaging service, which allows you to chat in private with vendors and basically anyone using the application. This means the Haven messenger service encrypts communications so the information can never be seen by third parties including OB1. Two people on Haven could communicate with each other in a private fashion, while the plain text information transmitted is purposely obfuscated. The Haven interface is pretty easy to use and allows for end-to-end encrypted messaging between two Haven users. To access the encrypted chat service on Haven, just tap the caption bubble to message someone or press the &#x201C;message&#x201D; tab on the user&#x2019;s profile page. If issues arise between two people, it is possible to report the user and block them so they cannot contact you using the platform. Overall the application works well and using the Haven platform interface is fairly intuitive. People can find the application on Google Play and Apple&#x2019;s App Store. The biggest downside is that Haven has got a long way to go to catch up with the social media incumbents, but Haven&#x2019;s privacy is a novel change that people have been asking for. The social media aspect tied to a built-in crypto marketplace may be enticing to digital currency veterans and newcomers alike. Additionally, privacy proponents will enjoy the platform&#x2019;s isolated shopping experience and encrypted chat options. What do you think about the Haven platform designed by the OB1 team?

Ether slipped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. Solana and BNB led the losers. SEC chairman Gary Gensler doubled down on why he is suing crypto exchanges as two U.S. congressmen proposed a bill to restructure the SEC and remove Gensler. Meantime, Ripple awaits the release of critical evidence that may shape its separate legal battle with the SEC.\nBitcoin rose 0.12% over the last 24 hours to US$25,928 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, gaining 0.8% in the past seven days. Ether slipped 0.66% to US$1,742, posting a 3.6% loss for the week.\nOut of other top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana and Binance’s BNB token were the biggest losers.\nThe two are among those that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified as illegally issued financial securities in lawsuits filed early last week against U.S. crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.US. The SEC has also filed to freeze the assets of Binance.US.\nSolana lost 2.18% to US$15.20 for a weekly slump of 23.98%. The BNB token fell 2.19% to US$230.60, a drop of 16.08% over the past week.\nPolygon and Cardano – two other crypto tokens named by the SEC as securities – gained on Tuesday morning but both are still down more than 20% since the SEC action.\nPolygon rose 1.40% to US$0.6434 for a weekly fall of 22.72%. Cardano gained 1.01% to US$0.2755 while losing 21.52% in value in the past week.\nSEC chairman Gary Gensler reemphasized the agency’s determination to strictly regulate the crypto sector in a repost on Twitter of hisstatementmade last week. “There’s nothing about the crypto securities markets that suggests that investors & issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws,” Genslertweeted.\nThe backlash against Gensler’s move to sue crypto exchanges is also growing:  #FireGaryGensler was trending on Twitter Tuesday morning in Asia as U.S. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson said Monday he filed a bill to restructure the SEC and in the process remove Gensler. The bill was backed by Republican Congressman Tom Emmer, but would need support from Democrats to go anywhere.\nCharlie Morris, managing partner of blockchain-focused venture capital CMCC Global, toldForkastin an email: “Rather than offering transparent regulation, the US is regulating by enforcement. This is resulting in uncertainty for project teams and investors, and markets do not like uncertainty.”\nMorris compared the U.S. approach to other regions: “It is interesting that this very negative approach to the digital asset sector appears to be localized in the U.S. This morning [UK Prime Minister] Rishi Sunak struck a very positive tone in welcoming Web3, andHong Konghas seen some very positive developments over the last couple of months.“\nOn Monday, Sunakwelcomedcrypto and blockchain-focused venture capital investor Andreessen Horowitz (a14z), which is setting up its first office outside of the U.S. in London.\nThe XRP token rose 1.07% to US$0.5243 Tuesday morning in Asia, bringing its weekly gain to 3.87%. Ripple Labs Inc., the cryptocurrency’s supervising entity, was sued by the SEC in December 2020, alleging XRP was offered and sold as an unregistered security.\nRipple Labs Chief Executive Officer Brad Garlinghouse on Monday made reference to the so-called “Hinman documents” named after former SEC director William Hinman, who said in an earlier speech that sales of the Ether token were not securities transactions. The comments are a major point of argument between the SEC and Ripple as Ripple seeks to bolster itsfair notice defense.\nIn a Mondaytweet, Garlinghouse said the documents, expected to be unsealed on Tuesday, were “worth the wait.”\nRulings in the Ripple and SEC case are expected to have ramifications across the entire crypto industry in setting how U.S. authorities classify cryptocurrencies.\nThe total cryptocurrency market cap lost 0.58% to US$1.05 trillion in the last 24 hours, while daily trading volume increased by 26.85% to US$30.58 billion, according to CoinMarketCapdata.\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed byCryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\nIn the non-fungible token (NFT) market, the Forkast 500 NFT index lost 1.64% to 2,974.36 in the 24 hours to 8:30 a.m. in Hong Kong. The index is down 9.69% for the week.\nTotal NFT sales fell 10.56% to US$19.3 million. Sales on Ethereum, the leading blockchain by volume, fell 18.31% over the last 24 hours to US$11.49 million, according to CryptoSlamdata.\n“The market is struggling due to low ETH volume, lowering prices, etc. The SEC filings is really beginning to impact the market,” said Yehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, the parent company of Forkast.News.\nThe Bitcoin network was the second largest NFT network in terms of sales transactions, despite losing 28.04% to US$2.1 million in the last 24 hours.\nInscriptions – the metadata added and stored into the smallest unit of Bitcoin, or Satoshis – may get anupgradeto allow them to be larger than 4 megabytes. “Now an inscription can reference another inscription, allowing more data to be stored and referenced. Generative art, games, etc, can now probably be stored on-chain,” said Petscher.\nBitcoin Ordinals and inscriptions are two new features to Bitcoin that were introduced in 2023 — Ordinals are unique identifiers for individual satoshis, while inscriptions are a way to attach metadata to satoshis.\nMythos chain-based DMarket recorded the highest sales as an NFT collection on Cryptoslam, with US$1.08 million in daily sales. DMarket is a global marketplace for trading in-game NFT items and goods that are powered by the Mythos blockchain.\nEthereum-based Bored Ape Yacht Club recorded the second highest sales in the past 24 hours of US$908,147, but that was a steep decline of 45.51% in the 24 hours.\nU.S. stock futures were little changed as of 9:50 a.m. in Hong Kong after gains in regular trading the previous day. Dow Jones Industrial Average futures fell 0.035%, while Nasdaq Futures gained 0.17%. S&P 500 futures edged 0.058% higher.\nDuring Monday’s regular trading, the Dow climbed 0.56%. The S&P 500 added 0.93%, and the Nasdaq jumped 1.53%.\nThe gains came on expectations the Federal Reserve will leave interest rates unchanged when it meets on Wednesday, according toTradingEconomics. U.S. rates are at 5% to 5.25%, the highest since 2006 after ten consecutive hikes that started in March 2022 to slow the pace of inflation that surged to 40-year highs at one stage.\n“Despite a stubbornly robust labour market and still too-sticky inflation, the markets now expect the world’s most influential central bank to pause its interest hike agenda this month,” said Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, in an email  statement.\n“This will firmly signal that progress is being made in the battle to cool inflation and this will buoy investors across the board, finally providing a boost to sectors which have been unloved so far this year,” Green added.\nThe CME FedWatch Tool predicts a 80.4% chance the Fed will leave rates as is at this week’s meeting, and a 19.6% chance for another 25-basis-point rate hike.\nHowever, former Fed vice chair Roger Ferguson toldCNBClast Friday that the central bank may raise rates later in the year even if it skips this time.\nThe monthly U.S. Consumer Price Index (CPI), a key inflation indicator, is released Tuesday for May and expectations are for a reading of 4.1% from 4.9% the prior month to indicate inflation is slowing, according toReuters.\n(updates with equity section) || Bitcoin rose in Tuesday morning trading in Asia, but failed to break through the US$26,000 ceiling. Ether slipped, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies by market capitalization were mixed. Solana and BNB led the losers. SEC chairman Gary Gensler doubled down on why he is suing crypto exchanges as two U.S. congressmen proposed a bill to restructure the SEC and remove Gensler. Meantime, Ripple awaits the release of critical evidence that may shape its separate legal battle with the SEC. Crypto mixed Bitcoin rose 0.12% over the last 24 hours to US$25,928 at 7:00 a.m. in Hong Kong, gaining 0.8% in the past seven days. Ether slipped 0.66% to US$1,742, posting a 3.6% loss for the week. Out of other top 10 cryptocurrencies, Solana and Binances BNB token were the biggest losers. The two are among those that the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) classified as illegally issued financial securities in lawsuits filed early last week against U.S. crypto exchanges Coinbase and Binance.US. The SEC has also filed to freeze the assets of Binance.US. Solana lost 2.18% to US$15.20 for a weekly slump of 23.98%. The BNB token fell 2.19% to US$230.60, a drop of 16.08% over the past week. Polygon and Cardano  two other crypto tokens named by the SEC as securities  gained on Tuesday morning but both are still down more than 20% since the SEC action. Polygon rose 1.40% to US$0.6434 for a weekly fall of 22.72%. Cardano gained 1.01% to US$0.2755 while losing 21.52% in value in the past week. SEC chairman Gary Gensler reemphasized the agencys determination to strictly regulate the crypto sector in a repost on Twitter of his statement made last week. Theres nothing about the crypto securities markets that suggests that investors & issuers are less deserving of the protections of our securities laws, Gensler tweeted . The backlash against Genslers move to sue crypto exchanges is also growing:  #FireGaryGensler was trending on Twitter Tuesday morning in Asia as U.S. Republican Congressman Warren Davidson said Monday he filed a bill to restructure the SEC and in the process remove Gensler. The bill was backed by Republican Congressman Tom Emmer, but would need support from Democrats to go anywhe...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: no_data\n- Bitcoin News: no_data\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): no_data\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\n• Galaxy Digital will move more of its operations offshore, Mike Novogratz says.\n• High-profile collapses have created a \"regulatory headache\" for the crypto firm in the US, he told analysts.\n• \"We still have a hangover … from the denting of trust that FTX and other bad actors in the space created,\" Novogratz added.\nCrypto investing giant Galaxy Digital is set to move more of its operations offshore because of a difficult regulatory environment in the US, its CEO Mike Novogratz said Tuesday.\nThe billionaire investor and bitcoin bull told analysts that the collapse of high-profile digital asset firms including failed exchange FTX have led to a crackdown in the US, leading to Galaxy focusing on accelerating growth abroad.\n\"When I look at the short term, we still have a regulatory headache in the United States,\" Novogratz said on aconference callafter the firm published its first-quarter earnings. \"I don't see that breaking anytime soon.\"\n\"We still have a hangover, as well, from the denting of trust that FTX and other bad actors in the space created,\" he added.\nNovogratz believes that crypto has entered a period of short-term \"stasis\" in the US because financial watchdogs like the Securities and Exchange Commission will continue to \"regulate with lawsuits.\"\nAmerican regulators launched a crypto crackdown after FTX imploded in November, targeting exchanges including Binance US, Kraken, and Gemini.

Illustration by Mitchell Preffer for Decrypt. This week’s crypto market was another mixed bag as the industry continues to navigate the continued contagion from the FTX collapse. Bitcoin and Ethereum again closed the week basically flat, which might be considered a win considering the losses some of the other top coins experience. As of Saturday morning, Bitcoin (BTC) was up less than 1% over the past seven days, and Ethereum (ETH) was down 1.5%. Most of the top 50 coins by market cap were in the red for the past week or, if in the green, up less than 2%. BTC fluctuated between roughly $17,300 and as low as $16,700, while Ethereum jumped between $1,300 and $1,225 as bears and bulls fought for control. But a rare winner over the past seven days was Axie Infinity’s native AXS token. The token rose by a whopping 21% since last weekend and is now trading hands at roughly $8.50, per CoinGecko . The AXS token is used in the popular play-to-earn crypto game, where users battle Pokémon-like creatures. AXS is the project’s governance token, allowing holders to vote on things like how the project’s treasury should be allocated, or proposed new features in the game. The game uses another token called the Smooth Love Potion (SLP), which is used as a reward for users for winning duels. This week’s spike follows the launch of the project’s Axie Contributors initiative. Roughly 700 “committed” members of the community will earn formal roles within the game’s governance model as part of Axie’s push for more informed discussions about how the game should operate. After AXS, the native token powering the self-custody crypto wallet Trust Wallet is also on a rally. TWT has risen roughly 6% over the past seven days, nearly hitting $3, per CoinGecko. Like Axie Infinity’s token, Trust Wallet is a governance token used to vote on new development for the Binance-owned wallet . Tokens for the decentralized exchange aggregator 1inch (1INCH), Chainlink (LINK), and Flow (FLOW), all round out this week’s biggest losers. Story continues FTX contagion continues The collapse of Sam Bankman-Fried’s crypto empire last month is still causing damage in the industry, with several firms announcing more layoffs this week in the wake of FTX's bankruptcy. Bybit, Swytfx , and Koinly all announced a cut in their workforce, citing both contagion from the collapse of FTX and the ongoing bear market. Besides layoffs, Maple Finance, a platform that lets firms spin up a lending facility using smart contracts, was also hit with knock-on effects. The platform announced this week that it would be cutting all ties with Orthogonal Trading after the latter “misrepresented” its exposure to FTX, leading it to default on its loans. M11 Credit, the firm that created the lending facility on Maple from which Orthogonal borrowed, said, \"we believe that Orthogonal Trading previously purposefully misstated their exposure and has therefore committed a serious breach of the Master Loan Agreement (MLA).\" It wasn’t just M11 and Maple that got burned. Crypto insurance protocol Nexus Mutual, another borrower from the same M11 pool, also revealed losses of roughly $3 million in Ethereum due to Orthogonal’s default. As for SBF, it looks like he’s finally heading back to Washington D.C. to testify before the House Financial Services Committee. After a public back and forth on Twitter with the Committee’s Chairwoman Maxine Waters, the former CEO of FTX said that he would be “willing to testify” despite “a limit” to what he can say due to not having “access to much of [his] data—professional or personal.” The meeting is slated for December 13 and will seek to unpack how the exchange collapsed last month.

Here are a few tips for weathering unfavorable market conditions.Option #1: Save cashThere’s no shame in sitting on the sidelines and saving cash or stablecoins. When bullish momentum returns, you will have plenty of dry powder to make big allocations. In the meantime, there are still lots of opportunities to earn yield across crypto markets as long as you trust the protocol you’re using. But isn’t this timing the market, which is impossible? Possibly. But this is more about spotting momentum and general market trends as opposed to more focused price targeting or calling reversals. Larger trends are easier to spot. However, if that’s a bit risky, there’s another option.Option #2: Dollar-cost average (DCA)Have you ever been to a physiotherapist with a wrist or back complaint? You’re hoping for a quick and easy cure, but instead, you’re given a sequence of trifling, tedious exercises to do daily for three months. Well, dollar-cost averaging is the investing equivalent of that. It’s not sexy or even very interesting but it has a very high chance of working out in your favor given a long enough time horizon. And these days, there are automated bots that do it for you, so that helps.These first two options could be combined to create a strategy. For example, putting 50% aside in stablecoins waiting for bullish momentum to return, and putting 50% into the market in a price-agnostic manner. This tactic allows for some exposure to the market, which can help in resisting FOMO when the market rallies, even though your overall thesis remains bearish.Option #3: Find assets that outperformDecentralized perpetual exchanges have been the darlings of the bear market. Following the FTX scandal, traders flocked to decentralized options, crying, “where can I short?” Many went to protocols such as GMX and ApeX, which are up about 70 and 50% this year, respectively.There will always be assets that outperform during bear markets but finding them is labor-intensive and going long during a downtrend is risky. So this strategy should be approached with caution and is best used by investors with the nous and experience to spot a good project and apply solid risk management.Option #4: Use derivativesThere are many strategies using derivatives and combinations of contracts to ensure profit in down-trending and sideways markets. For example, using options to create a “bear put spread” that allows you to make money when an asset falls by locking in a good selling price at a reduced rate.There are also pseudo-delta-neutral strategies that advanced yield farmers use to long and short both sides of a liquidity pool. This reduces their exposure to the volatility of the assets they are holding so they can collect the pool fees while reducing their downside exposure. The hard part is not so much actioning these strategies — there are instructions easily available online — but managing them and sizing your position. The management and position sizes can make or break these kinds of trades. They can be profitable in a bear market but should be used with caution. Option #5: Keep your head on while others are losing theirsUnless you’re a free climber like Alex Honnald, you wouldn’t attempt to scale any kind of cliff without good safety equipment. The same goes for crypto investing. What safety equipment? Well, an emergency fund that is kept in cash is a good starting point. It should cover about six months of basic living expenses and shouldn’t be used for yield, borrowed against or staked.You should also have a sinking fund, kept in similar circumstances (read: highly liquid) to pay for large expenses that crop up such as car repairs or, say, getting stuck in expensive Singapore for a week while your outgoing visa is delayed. The sinking fund will give you that extra buffer of support so you can keep your emergency fund pristine and use it for genuine emergencies only. Finally, recessions are hard, so remember to go look after your mental health. If you are worried about your portfolio or constantly checking the price, then you are making yourself less healthy and reducing the chance you will make good decisions when the time comes. Therefore, go outside, turn off the computer and play around.Develop your life outside your investing and trading activities. If you don’t do that, where will you go when you finally make it?

The data suggested that wholesale costs continued to rise and inflation may last longer than investors had previously believed. Oil prices are also still a focus for investors, with crude WTI hitting a new yearly low at $71.10 on Dec. 8.\\xa0The United States Dollar Index (DXY), a measure of the dollar’s strength against a basket of top foreign currencies, sustained the 104.50 level, but the index traded at 104.10, a 5-month low on Dec. 4. This signals low confidence in the U.S. Federal Reserve’s ability to curb inflation without causing a significant recession.Trader gutsareon noted that the choppy activity caused leverage longs and shorts to be liquidated, but it was followed by a failed tentative dump below $17,050.#BTC good study casefirst late shorts got taken out on the push..then late longs on the flush...then longs again on the PPI number...then shorts again...then a \"unusual\" low with little to no change in OI rollercoaster pic.twitter.com/Qju1eOuNMX— Peter (@gutsareon) December 9, 2022\\nAccording to the analysis, the open interest stagnation on futures contracts indicated low confidence from bears.Regulatory uncertainty could have played a key role in limiting Bitcoin\\'s upside. On Dec. 8, the United States Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) issued new guidance that could see publicly traded companies disclose their exposure to crypto assets.The SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance said that the recent crisis in the crypto asset industry has “caused widespread disruption” and that U.S. companies might have disclosure obligations under federal securities laws to disclose whether these events could impact their business.Let’s look at derivatives metrics to understand better how professional traders are positioned in the current market conditions.Bitcoin margin longs faced a drastic increaseMargin markets provide insight into how professional traders are positioned because it allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their positions.For example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy Bitcoin. On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only short the cryptocurrency as they bet on its price declining. Unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn’t always matched.OKX stablecoin/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKXThe above chart shows that OKX traders’ margin lending ratio increased from Dec. 4 to Dec. 9, signaling that professional traders increased their leverage longs even after multiple failed attempts to break above the $17,300 resistance.Currently at 35, the metric favors stablecoin borrowing by a wide margin and indicates that shorts are not confident about building bearish leveraged positions.Option traders remain risk-averseTraders should analyze options markets to understand whether Bitcoin will eventually succumb to the bearish newsflow. The 25% delta skew is a telling sign whenever arbitrage desks and market makers are overcharging for upside or downside protection.The indicator compares similar call (buy) and put (sell) options and will turn positive when fear is prevalent because the protective put options premium is higher than risk call options.In short, the skew metric will move above 10% if traders fear a Bitcoin price crash. On the other hand, generalized excitement reflects a negative 10% skew.Bitcoin 60-day options 25% delta skew: Source: LaevitasAs displayed above, the 25% delta skew improved between Dec. 4 and Dec. 9, shows options traders reduced their risk aversion for unexpected price dumps. However, at the current 15%, the delta skew signals that investors remain fearful because market makers are less included in offering downside protection.From one side, the lack of open interest increase as Bitcoin tested the intraday low on Dec. 9 seems encouraging. Still, excessive use of margin indicates that buyers might be forced to reduce their positions during surprise downside moves.The longer it takes for Bitcoin to recapture $18,000, the riskier it becomes for leverage margin longs. Traditional markets continue to play an essential role in setting the trend, so a potential retest down to $16,000 cannot be ruled out.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are th...\n- Bitcoin News: [[563434, '2022-12-10 23:30:17', 'Judge Dismisses Crypto Lawsuit Against Kim Kardashian', 'judge-dismisses-crypto-lawsuit-against-kim-kardashian', 'Kevin Helms', 'A class action lawsuit against Kim Kardashian and Floyd Mayweather Jr. over their promotion of crypto token ethereummax has been dismissed.

The reality TV star settled with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) in October for failing to disclose a $250,000 compensation for touting the crypto token on her Instagram account. Mayweather Jr. promoted the same crypto token at a boxing match and a large Miami bitcoin conference in June 2021. Attorney John Jasnoch told Fitzgerald: If plaintiffs had known the true facts related to the promoters&#8217; financial interest in the tokens, and that they were being paid to shill these tokens, they wouldn&#8217;t have paid as much for the tokens as they did. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Investors sued Ethereummax&#8217;s founders and the crypto project&#8217;s celebrity promoters in January after the EMAX cryptocurrency lost 97% of its value.

The Tesla boss replied: Just a rough guess, but things probably start looking better in Q2 2024. This was not the first time Musk warned about the consequences of the Fed hiking interest rates. At the end of November, the billionaire said the trend was concerning. He urged the Federal Reserve to cut interest rates immediately, stating that the U.S. central bank is &#8220;massively amplifying the probability of a severe recession.&#8221; He agreed with Ark Invest CEO Cathie Wood that the Fed&#8217;s actions could lead to a 1929-like Great Depression. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell has signaled a 50-basis-point rate hike in December following four consecutive 75-basis-point hikes. &#8220;It makes sense to moderate the pace of our rate increases as we approach the level of restraint that will be sufficient to bring inflation down,” Powell said.

Rich Dad Poor Dad is a 1997 book co-authored by Kiyosaki and Sharon Lechter. It has been on the New York Times Best Seller List for over six years. More than 32 million copies of the book have been sold in over 51 languages across more than 109 countries.

The famous author has warned on several occasions that the U.S. pension crisis is much worse than we thought. In 2020, he co-authored a book titled &#x201C;Who Stole My Pension?&#x201D; with Edward Siedle. In the book, the authors discussed &#x201C;the greatest retirement crisis in the history of our nation and &#x2026; the entire world.&#x201D; When pension funds almost collapsed recently in England, Kiyosaki warned that a similar situation could happen in the U.S. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Kiyosaki previously explained that &#x201C;the U.S. dollar became fake money&#x201D; when President Richard Nixon removed it from the gold standard in 1971. &#x201C;This is because rather than being tied to real money,&#x201D; such as gold, &#x201C;it was tied to the &#x2018;full faith and credit&#x2019; of the United States,&#x201D; the Rich Dad Poor Dad author noted. In September, he said the end of fake money is here; he expects the U.S. dollar to crash by January. The renowned author has said repeatedly that he doesn&#x2019;t trust the Federal Reserve, the Treasury, President Joe Biden, and Wall Street. In February, he warned that the Fed and the Treasury are destroying the U.S. dollar, advising people to buy bitcoin. He recently stressed that cryptocurrency cannot be blamed for the collapse of crypto exchange FTX, emphasizing that bitcoin is not the problem.

Following a 0.05% gain on Thursday, Bitcoin ended the month up by 24.04% to $11,350.0. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning intraday low $10,990 before making a move. Steering clear of the first major support level at $10,923.2, Bitcoin rose to a late afternoon intraday high $11,440.0. Bitcoin broke through the first major resistance level at $11,255.4 and the second major resistance level at $11,387.8. A late pullback saw Bitcoin fall back through the resistance levels before finding support. Bitcoin broke back through the first major resistance level to wrap up the day at $11,350 levels. The near-term bullish trend remained intact, supported by the latest move through to $11,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $6,400 to form a near-term bearish trend. The Rest of the Pack Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Friday. Binance Coin (+7.76%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+7.19%), and Ripple’s XRP (+6.22%) led the way. Bitcoin Cash ABC (+2.22%), Ethereum (+3.46%), Litecoin (+2.46%), and Monero’s XMR (+4.39%), also found strong support. EOS (+1.36%), Stellar’s Lumen (+0.73%), Tezos (+1.44%), and Tron’s TRX (+1.93%) trailed the front runners. Cardano’s ADA bucked the trend, however, falling by 1.17%.

Bitcoin Cash SV (+46.21%), Ethereum (+53.82%), Litecoin (+41.45%), Ripple’s XRP (+48.21%), and Stellar’s Lumen (+45.72%) also found strong support.

In the current week, the crypto total market cap rose from a Monday low $285.49bn to a Monday high $335.81bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $326.94bn. Story continues Bitcoin’s dominance rose from a Monday low 62.44% to a Tuesday high 64.58% before easing back. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 63.53. This Morning At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.82% to $11,257.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $11,398 before falling to a low $11,238.0. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC (+0.14%), Cardano’s ADA (+0.21%), and Stellar’s Lumen (+0.69%) found early support. It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors, however. Ripple’s XRP was down by 1.44% to lead the way down. For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move through the $11,260 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $11,530. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Friday’s high $11,440. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside. In the event of a crypto breakout, Bitcoin could eye the second major resistance level at $11,710. Failure to move through the $11,260 pivot level would bring the first major support level at $11,080 into play. Barring an extended crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$11,000 levels and the second major support level at $10,810.

Ripple’s XRP was down by 1.44% to lead the way down. For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move through the $11,260 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $11,530. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break out from Friday’s high $11,440.

The enthusiasm is warranted. We’re starting to see the fruits of many years of hard work pay off with DEX trading volume and use increasing every day.\\xa0In spite of this growth, the vast majority of crypto trading still takes place on centralized exchanges. DEXs offer a clear set of benefits in terms of fund security, flexible custody and transparency, so why is it that the majority of the market still shuns them in favor of centralized alternatives? We think we know the answer, and we’ve spent the last year and a half working to build a next-generation DEX that can go head-to-head with centralized exchanges. We continue to make progress, and we want to share some reflections, insights and observations that have shaped our innovations.It’s all about the market makersMarket makers drive the crypto market. They bring much-needed liquidity to platforms, without which it’s impossible to attract traders and end users. Market makers are the linchpin of the exchange flywheel. Additional liquidity brings more traders, which brings more market makers, which brings more liquidity — and so on.We’ve spent countless hours talking with the most influential traders and market makers in the industry, and two things are clear:(Almost) none of them are market making on DEXs todayAll of them are interested in market making on DEXs in the future.So, what’s the problem? The glaring issue is that market makers have spent millions of dollars and working hours to build technology and human capital that interface with existing exchanges. These systems are built with certain assumptions around performance and features — assumptions that are broken by all existing DEXs. We can’t expect market makers to rebuild their systems from the ground up for a tiny slice of the overall market. If we want to tackle centralized exchanges with any level of success, we have to meet these important participants where they are today.What’s missing from DEXs?You may be thinking you already know the answer. Everyone has heard the criticism that the current generation of DEXs doesn’t scale. Multiple teams are seeking to address this by implementing layer-two systems that can lower transaction costs for trade settlement.These new developments are great and bring much-needed room for growth — provided anyone uses the product in the first place. Layer-two systems only remove limitations on growth; they don’t do anything to make the exchange an attractive product in the first place. Any serious trading product must first meet the bar set by existing alternatives before it is able to compete on a unique selling proposition, which in the case of DEXs is custody flexibility and transparent fund security.So, what’s really going on? If we take a deeper look at the current landscape for decentralized trading products, we can conclude that three primary issues are plaguing DEXs and preventing wider adoption and use:\\xa0 \\xa0 1. High latency and low performanceThese items lead to a whole host of issues. Front-running and trade collisions break “price-time priority” and lead to unfair trade execution. Delays in execution of trades or cancels make it impossible for market makers to quote deep, tight spreads, lest they risk getting arbitraged due to price changes on other venues.To address this, an exchange must have a high-performance, in-memory trading engine. It must also be able to handle bursts of traffic and hundreds of thousands of orders per second with low millisecond latency. A simple layer-two system is not sufficient to provide the performance and execution guarantees that the market demands.\\xa0 \\xa0 2. Lack of features and non-standard formatsMarket makers and algorithmic traders have a large number of venues to choose from. These players assess new opportunities not only by the potential revenue and income they will generate but also by the upfront integration and ongoing maintenance costs. This ratio of opportunity to cost is the most important determining factor, as it’s a representation of the efficiency of their development work and capital.DEXs need to be 100% plug-and-play in order for new participants to join and provide liquidity with minimal effort. After all, if you’ve already designed a winning strategy, why take the time to redo it to suit a market share of less than 2%? This includes offering the same advanced order types as other top tier exchanges, and an API format and documentation that adheres to the unofficial standards that have emerged.\\xa0 \\xa0 3. Lack of complianceKnow Your Customer and Anti-Money Laundering policies are a reality for all participants with significant amounts of capital. We’ve had multiple conversations with market makers that declined to engage with us under the assumption that, as a DEX, we weren’t compliant. Whether we like it or not, it’s impossible for high net worth individuals and institutional players to trade on platforms that don’t meet their basic compliance needs.Where are we now?Analyzing current products through this lens, we can see why DEX adoption is still limited. We used off-chain execution to eliminate on-chain front-running and trade collisions, but it did not have the matching engine necessary to provide the execution guarantees that top participants demanded. The API did not adhere to industry standards, which led to unnecessary complexity and stifled development efforts.Automated market makers, or AMMs, are a clever solution to circumvent some of the latency and performance issues that make it impossible to host a liquid order book on-chain (pricing in AMMs is only updated when someone takes an order). However, these pricing curves are, by definition, a less flexible option than order books and far from ideal for professional market makers who have the capacity to make markets more efficiently. Additionally, due to the use of on-chain execution, these platforms suffer from front-running and manipulation.Existing layer-two DEXs have a similar set of issues. The lack of a proper matching engine leads to inefficient pricing and robs market makers of necessary execution guarantees. User friction such as the need to register separate keys, asset quanta and other factors makes it time-consuming for developers to adapt their operations to support layer-two DEXs. In addition, market makers still need to contend with the security implications of using relatively immature cryptography to secure valuable crypto assets.Ultimately, scalability still matters, but only if you have something worth scaling. The issue at the moment for central limit order book DEXs is not so much that we can’t fit enough transactions on-chain but that the process for creating these settlement transactions is clunky and unintuitive.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Alex Wearn is the co-founder and CEO of IDEX, a cryptocurrency exchange focused on performance and security. .

Many people falsely assume that crypto proponents are for a cashless society and this is certainly not the case. If we removed the central banks&#x2019; printing fiasco and the inflationary practices from cash, we all know that cash is great for anonymity and fungibility. But the nation-states and central banking cabal are in charge of the fiat game and the monetary system today does come with serious manipulation and inflation. Most crypto supporters, just because they support an electronic currency, do not support the removal of cash money. But there is little anyone can do to stop the government from going cashless. Now we all know that cash is great (besides the inflationary aspects), but we also know that cryptocurrencies are even better. Crypto transactions like bitcoin (BTC) do not have to be electronic every time someone transacts. With cryptos like bitcoin, we can create all kinds of bearer bond instruments. A digital asset can be hidden in mnemonic phrase and most seeds are based on 12, 18, or 24-word phrases that are tied to their private key(s). The use of mnemonics, or &#x2018;memoria technica,&#x2019; is derived from the era of the ancient Greeks when Aristotle and Plato philosophized about certain types of logic. The photo below is a depiction of the Knuckle mnemonic, which represents the number of days in each month of the Gregorian Calendar. Any amount of crypto, like a billion dollars worth of crypto assets, for instance, can be stored in a mnemonic. This means you can keep a billion dollars hidden in a book, or even by memory if you have a decent photographic memory. Bitcoin can be printed on paper, metal, plastic, and people can create all types of cash instruments. Individuals also store mnemonic seed words using metal devices in order to protect funds from water and fire damage. Paper wallets like trash can be ruined by water and fire. Now just like gold, a bundle of cash can be quite cumbersome to carry. You cannot travel lightly with a billion dollars worth of cash in a few bags. You also have to be vigilant, protective, and someone can take your bundles of cash like a mugger or even law enforcement. For instance, the U.S. agency Homeland Security seized $2 billion in cash from travelers during the course of six years at U.S. airports. But think about what I just said. You can store any amount of money on a piece of paper. On a small square of aluminum. You can write down 12-words on a piece of paper and hand a family member tens of thousands of dollars&#x2014; no questions asked. Paper wallets can be created with most crypto assets like bitcoin (BTC), ethereum (ETH), bitcoin cash (BCH), monero (XMR), and litecoin (LTC). No need for the duffle bags of loot, you can simply leverage a mnemonic or a piece of paper. Hiding crypto is extremely easy and someone can even do it by leveraging steganographic tools. Literally hiding a million dollars in plain sight. Steganography is the art of concealing images, messages, files, or videos. The practice of obscuring messages in this fashion was first recorded in 440 BC. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); So in many ways, cryptocurrencies are an advanced form of cash and you are just not aware of all the possibilities if you think crypto people are &#x201C;anti-cash.&#x201D; This is simply not true. To a great degree, digital currencies are simply a better form of money and many people just haven&#x2019;t figured that out yet.

No one knows exactly how a second wave of coronavirus infections might affect traditional or digital-asset markets. Some analysts argue that better preparation and existing restrictions mean the effects could be more muted. In order to minimize disruption, governments might move quickly to isolate outbreaks, rather than resorting to further large-scale lockdowns. You’re reading First Mover , CoinDesk’s daily markets newsletter. Assembled by the CoinDesk Markets Team, First Mover starts your day with the most up-to-date sentiment around crypto markets, which of course never close, putting in context every wild swing in bitcoin and more.

Related: Blockchain Bites: Trump on Bitcoin, Powell on Digital Dollars and the Truth About Terrorist Financing But the action in markets last week might have provided glimpse of how things would play out in the event that the contagion came back – or even if doubts emerged about the prospects for an economic recovery. Stocks and bitcoin tumbled last week amid concerns the number of cases is rising and as the Federal Reserve warned a full economic recovery isn’t likely for at least three years. Markets recovered quickly, partly due to an announcement of fresh stimulus from the Federal Reserve. But cryptocurrency analysts say the episode shows bitcoin might tumble anew if traditional markets swoon again. “Should a second wave hit this year, bitcoin will likely continue moving in correlation with the overall market,” Jonathan Leong, CEO of BTSE exchange, said in comments to First Mover.

Story continues After more than 50 days without a reported case, health authorities in Beijing reported 36 new cases on Saturday, believed to have been carried in on imported salmon sold at a local market. City officials shut down surrounding neighborhoods, and major supermarkets pulled salmon from shelves. Daily records of new cases have also cropped up some U.S. states that have started reopening, including Florida, Texas and Arizona . In France, where President Emmanuel Macron declared a “ first victory ” against the illness and reopened cafes and restaurants, he has warned the pandemic could easily return. The risk has spurred some cryptocurrency analysts to start asking how bitcoin might perform if conditions took a turn for the worse. The memories are still fresh of the sell-off on March 12, now known as “Black Thursday,” when the Standard & Poor’s 500 Index of large U.S. stocks tumbled almost 10%, and bitcoin fell 39%. Rapid pledges of trillions of dollars of liquidity injections by central banks helped to put a floor under markets. By mid-May, central banks and governments had injected roughly $15 trillion into the global economy . Both bitcoin and U.S. stocks recovered. Over the past week, the pattern returned. From last Thursday through Monday, the S&P 500 fell by nearly 7% and bitcoin tumbled, too. The markets rebounded after the Federal Reserve announced Monday it would start buying individual corporate bonds as part of an expanded program that might eventually reach $750 billion of total assets. The Bank of Japan (BoJ) also announced it was ready to pump an additional trillion dollars’ worth of yen into local companies. “The latest demonstration of seemingly unlimited central bank support drowned out the worrying news,” Michael Mackenzie wrote in his Market Forces newsletter for the Financial Times. For the past several months, bitcoin and U.S. stocks have shown a weak but persistent correlation. Mati Greenspan, founder of the foreign-exchange and cryptocurrency research firm Quantitative Economics, wrote Tuesday in an email to subscribers that the question of whether bitcoin will crash with stocks “keeps coming up lately.” “The clearer it gets that we may be in for further pain in the stock markets, the more people want to know if bitcoin will again participate in a multi-asset sell-off,” he wrote. Investors are likely to be “a lot more prepared” for a second crash, he said, and there’s a possibility that a “bout of extreme volatility could break the correlation” between bitcoin and stocks. “Of course, it’s only a theory,” Greenspan said. Tweet of the day Bitcoin watch BTC : Price: $9,434 ( BPI ) | 24-Hr High: $9,557 | 24-Hr Low: $9,240 Trend: Bitcoin continues to defend key support and may challenge the $10,000 market in the short term. The leading cryptocurrency by market value is currently trading near $9,440, having defended the ascending (bullish) 50-day moving average (MA) support at $9,375 early on Thursday. Sellers have repeatedly failed to establish a strong foothold below the 50-day SMA in the last week. So far bitcoin has not been able to capitalize on the dip demand, or seller exhaustion, seen below the average support. The range play, however, could soon end with a breakout on the higher side, according to bullish developments on the three-day chart. To start with, the 50- and 100-candle MAs have produced a bull cross for the first time June 2016. Back then, the confirmation of the bullish crossover had accelerated the preceding uptrend. Similarly, bitcoin broke into a bull market in the October 2015 following a bull cross of the same two averages. In addition, the cryptocurrency created a classic long-tailed bullish hammer candle in the three-days to June 17, marking a strong dip demand near support at $8,876. That level marks the 23.6% Fibonacci retracement of the rally from $3,867 to $10,429. With the three-day chart reporting bullish patterns, technical traders may enter the market, lifting prices higher. The immediate resistance is seen at $9,566, followed by $10,000. On the downside, the Fibonacci support at $8,876 is the level to beat for the sellers.

Compounding the sell-off is soaring inflation, higher interest rates and, more recently, a possible U.S. recession.\nAt 19:45 GMT,September E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index futuresare trading 11536.50, down 154.50 or -1.32%. TheInvesco QQQ Trust ETF (QQQ)is at $280.22, down $3.58 or -1.26%.\nIn economic news, a Commerce Department report showedU.S. consumer spendingrose less than expected in May. While the report suggestedinflationhad probably peaked, price pressures are expected to stick around, which means the U.S. Federal Reserve should remain on its aggressive policy-tightening path.\nTrader reaction to the short-term Fibonacci level at 11524.50 is likely to determine the direction of the September E-mini NASDAQ-100 Index into the close on Thursday.\nA sustained move under 11524.50 will indicate the presence of sellers. Consequently, look for the index to eventually retest the last main bottom at 11068.50 if this move creates enough downside momentum.\nTaking out 11068.50 will reaffirm the downtrend. This could lead to a quick test of the November 2, 2020 main bottom at 10944.00.\nA sustained move over 11524.50 will signal the presence of buyers. This could trigger a quick move into the long-term 50% level at 11671.25.\nOvercoming 11671.25 will be a sign of strength. This could trigger a late session short-covering rally into the intermediate retracement zone at 12021.25 to 12246.00. This zone essentially stopped the buying at 12262.00 on June 27.\nThe short-term direction is likely to be determined by trader reaction to 11671.25 and 11524.25.\nAggressive counter-trend buyers are going to try to overcome 11671.25 in an effort to form a potentially bullish secondary higher bottom. Sellers are going to try to drive the index through 11524.25. Their goal is to continue the downtrend.\nFor a look at all of today’s economic events, check out oureconomic calendar.\nThisarticlewas originally posted on FX Empire\n• Guatemala, Mexico families mourn missing teenage sons after migrant tragedy\n• Surge in U.S. demand for Dutch abortion pills after Roe v.

When two objects move in opposite directions, their relative speed is the sum of their individual speeds.\n\nSoyun's speed = 5 km/h\nJia's speed = 4 km/h\n\nRelative speed = Soyun's speed + Jia's speed\nRelative speed = 5 km/h + 4 km/h\nRelative speed = 9 km/h\n\nSince they meet after running around the park with a perimeter of 18 km, it means they have covered the entire perimeter together.\n\nLet's denote the time it took for them to meet as t (in hours). We can use the formula:\n\nDistance = Speed × Time\n\nSince they meet after covering the entire perimeter together, we can write:\n\n18 km = Relative speed × Time\n18 km = 9 km/h × t\n\nNow, we solve for t:\n\nt = 18 km / 9 km/h\nt = 2 hours\n\nNow we know that they met after 2 hours. To find out how far Soyun ran, we multiply Soyun's speed by the time:\n\nDistance Soyun ran = Soyun's speed × Time\nDistance Soyun ran = 5 km/h × 2 hours\nDistance Soyun ran = 10 km\n\nSo, Soyun ran 10 kilometers before meeting Jia."}

The project has attracted heavy hitter investors such as OroPocket, Master Ventures, Blocksync Ventures, X21, Magnus Capital, GenBlock Capital and AU21.\nInvesting in the Crypto-currency industry remains a complex undertaking for most people.\nFinding the right market to invest in, at the right time can be intimidating, mainly due to the persistent volatility. For this reason, TeraBlock has developed an automated machine learning trading and investment management solution that can lower the barriers for those who wish to enter the market seamlessly.\nMaking Crypto Investments EasierPeople who are unfamiliar with crypto-currencies may find it difficult to invest in Bitcoin or other assets. There is a steep learning curve in this industry that turns many people away. No one wants to, or has the capacity to study every aspect of crypto industry, comparing different markets or finding the right time to invest during volatile periods.\nIn traditional finance, investing in different currencies, assets or markets is relatively simple. Exposure to other sectors can be done through direct means, with or without the help of external parties. It's a very simple process, but such solutions are a bit difficult to find when it comes to crypto-currencies.\nIn the current landscape, specific currencies can be purchased regularly through a method known as dollar cost averaging. Implementing this method for multiple currencies becomes more complex than necessary. TeraBlock wants to change this narrative by combining innovative technologies with Crypto-currency investment.\nIt's also important to note that TeraBlock offers a simple way (a fiat onramp) to purchase crypto-currencies. With native support for credit and debit cards, purchasing Bitcoin and other supported assets will become much easier. TeraBlock taps into Binance's deep liquidity to provide competitive pricing for those who wish to buy or sell their crypto-currency at any time.\nDifferent Indices For Different Risk AppetitesAs the crypto-currency industry grows over time, investing in the right markets and assets is essential. Rather than discovering these opportunities on ones own, TeraBlock offers direct exposure to four different indexes. These are based on market capitalization, recent performance, project overview and statistical data. Each option has its own advantages and disadvantages, depending on risk appetite.\nOnce a user opts for a specific index, the machine learning algorithm will buy the assets according to the user's instructions and continuously monitor the market. If the market starts going in the wrong direction, the trading engine will exit that market pair until things normalize again. With the use of low frequency trading, users will not see too many changes in their overall investment basket.\nLeveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) For Automated TradingIt's not entirely uncommon to see artificial intelligence and/or machine learning in financial products and services these days. The financial industry has robo-advisors that help people automate their investments and manage their portfolios over time. In most cases, the AI or ML algorithm will even rebalance its portfolio based on current market conditions and overall risk appetite.\nTeraBlock now wants to bring this same approach to the crypto-currency industry. Using artificial intelligence and machine learning, users will be able to gain confidence in a new asset class without friction. This is critical when it comes to notoriously volatile markets, even on a good day. Seeing prices plunge or rise more than 20-40% in one day is far from uncommon in this sector.\nTeraBlock's solutions offers 100% automated portfolio management. Funds will be protected from volatility and the algorithm strives to provide consistent growth over time. Since the underlying algorithm learns and adapts, Terablock users could potentially enjoy more successful trades over time.\nClosing ThoughtsMaking crypto-currencies more attractive, is an essential part of the evolution of this industry. Things are moving in the right direction, but a lot of work is yet to be done.\nThe platform offered by TeraBlock shows what the future of crypto adoption could look like. A solution that lowers the barrier to market volatility that can be utilized by users, amateurs or advanced alike.Follow TeraBlock's media channels to stay up to date with the latest news:\nOfficial Website:https://terablock.ai/Telegram Chat:-t.me/TeraBlockMedium:https://myterablock.medium.comTwitter :https://twitter.com/MyTeraBlockLinkedIn :https://www.linkedin.com/company/myterablock/\nMedia Contact:RTCMedia@RT.CapitalWebsite:https://RT.Capital\nSOURCE:TeraBlock\nView source version on accesswire.com:https://www.accesswire.com/645595/AI-Based-Trade-Automation-The-Case-of-TeraBlock || Occam Association is excited to announce their IDO launching through the OccamRazer platform - DeFIRE - a project incubated and nurtured by OccamFi and powered by Changelly.\nDecentralized Finance and Fundraising: The case of Occam.fi\nZUG, SWITZERLAND / ACCESSWIRE / May 6, 2021 /First, what is decentralized Finance (DeFi)? DeFi is an inclusion of all the financial services that don't have a central authority (a particular person or organization in charge). Financial system services include; money transfer, savings plans, loans, stock market, and insurance. Traditionally, the financial system is centralized and the authorities in charge are banks, insurance companies, and stock markets. And these institutions also have someone in charge. The centralized finance system has risks such as fraud, corruption, or mismanagement. Using cryptocurrencies (decentralized money e.g Bitcoin) one can build exchanges, insurance companies, and lending services that aren't owned or controlled by any authority.\nTraditionally, when one needed to start a new business venture, they'd find ways of raising funds either through bank loans or bringing together a group of people physically or online. In the case of decentralized finance, fundraising is Blockchain-based and is referred to as crowdfunding. Initially starting with ICOs (initial coin offerings) to a much more refined IDO models (Initial Dex Offerings), better known to many as launchpads. Some advantages of this decentralized fundraising include speed, flexibility, automation, efficiency, and the ability for projects to get funded by investors from all over the globe. Most of the action has thus far taken place on Ethereum. Until now.\nEnter Occam.fi to the DeFi world, on the Cardano network.\nWhat is Occam.fi?\nOccam.fi offers the first decentralized fundraising launchpad for Cardano called OccamRazer. A platform that enables new Blockchain projects to raise funds as well as giving investors early access to the tokens or coins. Cardano is a Blockchain platform based on proof-of-stake (PoS) onto which Dapps or decentralized projects can be built. Just like Facebook is built on the internet, decentralized applications (Dapps) are built on the Cardano network.\nOccamRazer will enable projects to raise funds by providing many types of unique fundraising mechanisms. Presenting a robust working product, where every project can carry out fundraising in a decentralized manner. It suits various fundraising profiles and is intended to drive the unlocking of Cardano ecosystems' liquidity.\nApart from the Launchpad, Occam.fi plans to launch a decentralized exchange (DEX) and a DAO-based layer for governance.\nThe Occam ecosystem will be operating through OCC tokens which will be launched as Cardano native tokens. The OCC tokens will be used to access liquidity pools, and for staking.\nThe Problem Occam.fi solves\nThe traditional way of fundraising has disadvantages such as exclusivity, cost efficiency, and a limited possibility of investors. On the other hand, most of the decentralized fundraising systems that have come up before still face shortcomings such as bias, and volatility.\nCardano's ADA has been considered valueless before because ADA holders couldn't stake the tokens for the purposes of yield generation. ADA had limited uses and utility. Cardano, therefore, has a large pool of dormant liquidity. Introducing DeFi on Cardano will pave way for projects to be launched on Cardano. Also, such projects will be in need of an efficient decentralized fundraising vehicle.\nThe Occam.fi solution\nOccam.fi offers a simple proposition aimed at assisting various types of projects that are seeking that initial investment. This solution is to be offered efficiently. Through fundraising for private and public rounds.\nAdditionally, through OccamRazer, Occam addresses issues of speed and cost of fundraising while solving all the other shortcomings of the current decentralized exchange fundraising. The shortcoming includes volatility and intricacies that are unaccounted for. The OccamRazer product is also intended to provide value by being user-friendly.\nWhat Makes Occam a Great Solution?\nOccamRazor is bringing speed, low cost, and transparency to decentralized financing. Also, it will accommodate all types of project sizes from the smallest to the largest.\nCurrently, Ether holders find it hard to fund new projects that are built on other blockchains. Through the cross-chain bridge that Occam will create they will be able to do that.\nOccam will allow utilization of the dormant liquidity on Cardano giving the ADA token more value. Up until now, has been a huge unrealized benefit to the Cardano community,\nConclusion\nIn conclusion, Occam.fi comes as good news to both Cardano and the new projects that want an inclusive, efficient, and cost-e...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: no_data\n- Bitcoin News: no_data\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): no_data\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nBitcoinattracts more investors after a series of BTC purchases by Microstrategy and a groundbreaking $1.5B investment in Bitcoin by Tesla.

If the walk took 4 hours in total, how much time would be taken for the first walk?", "output": "Let's denote the time taken for the first walk as \\( t \\) hours. Since the speed during the first walk was 3 km/h, the distance covered during the first walk would be \\( 3t \\) kilometers.\n\nFor the second walk, the speed was 4 km/h, and the distance was 2 km more than the first walk, so the distance for the second walk would be \\( 3t + 2 \\) kilometers. Let's denote the time taken for the second walk as \\( s \\) hours. Therefore, the distance covered during the second walk would be \\( 4s \\) kilometers.\n\nAccording to the problem, the total time for both walks is 4 hours, so we have:\n\\[ t + s = 4 \\]\n\nWe also know that the distance covered in the second walk (at 4 km/h) is equal to the distance covered in the first walk (at 3 km/h) plus 2 km, so we can write:\n\\[ 4s = 3t + 2 \\]\n\nNow we have two equations:\n1. \\( t + s = 4 \\)\n2. \\( 4s = 3t + 2 \\)\n\nWe can solve these equations simultaneously to find the value of \\( t \\). Let's solve equation 1 for \\( s \\):\n\\[ s = 4 - t \\]\n\nNow we substitute \\( s \\) in equation 2 with \\( 4 - t \\):\n\\[ 4(4 - t) = 3t + 2 \\]\n\\[ 16 - 4t = 3t + 2 \\]\n\nNow, let's solve for \\( t \\):\n\\[ 16 - 2 = 3t + 4t \\]\n\\[ 14 = 7t \\]\n\\[ t = \\frac{14}{7} \\]\n\\[ t = 2 \\]\n\nSo, the time taken for the first walk is 2 hours."}

When Bitcoin (BTC) was first envisioned, one of its selling points was the fact that it was offering better protection to retailers than credit cards. In one of his earliest emails — from November 10, 2008, Satoshi Nakamoto parried a complaint from an early adopter James A. Donald, who lamented the fact that Bitcoin transactions are not instantaneously final:“Instantant non-repudiability is not a feature, but it's still much faster than existing systems. Paper cheques can bounce up to a week or two later. Credit card transactions can be contested up to 60 to 180 days later. Bitcoin transactions can be sufficiently irreversible in an hour or two.”According to Cohen, in some cases, credit card chargebacks are possible 18 months after the transaction date. There are two classifications of credit card chargebacks: unauthorized use (when a criminal gains access to one’s credit card) and authorized (where a cardholder authorized the transaction but is not satisfied with the outcome). Cohen said that when it comes to crypto, consumers may have a chance of recovering funds only in the case of unauthorized transactions, as credit companies like MasterCard and Visa exclude certain industries like crypto and gambling from the second category. Cohen opined that the ubiquity of scammers who use crypto as a tool hampers mass adoption:“Unfortunately, it's a very nice tool for a scammer to have as a means to collect funds. I think it serves in the disinterest of those who are looking to promote the general and universal usage of crypto. I think it is at this point. It is somewhat of a stumbling block because of all of the people who are getting scammed. I mean, they're not going to be the ones who are going to be promoting the usage.”Cohen said that one of the most typical tropes of scammers involves them offering some product or service (the most common tend to be related to forex trading) to an unsuspecting customer. Then at the last moment, the scammer convinces the unsuspecting victim to pay for the service or fund their supposed-account using cryptocurrency. According to Cohen, not all is lost for the victims, however; there may be potential avenues for redress. Cohen’s company helps the victims identify scammers by tracing their movements on the blockchain. Typically this leads to a crypto exchange where the criminals deposit the proceeds of their crimes before cashing out. Cohen said that many crypto exchanges have been receptive and are truly eager to stamp out users who engage their services for nefarious purposes.Recently, two offices of the U.S. Department of the Treasury have issued advisories to the crypto companies, primarily exchanges, about processing malware attack payouts. A few days later, the U.S. government went after BitMex and its founder for operating an unregistered trading platform. As crypto regulation tightens around the world, it appears that cashing out of ill-gotten proceeds could become increasingly more difficult for the criminals.\"], [53900, 'bloomberg-bitcoin-has-had-a-tendency-of-adding-zeroes-to-its-price', 29834, 'Bloomberg: Bitcoin ‘has had a tendency of adding zeroes to its price’', '2020-10-05 20:50:06', 'Bitcoin may take twice as long to get to $100,000 than previously surmised.', 'In its latest crypto newsletter, Bloomberg observes that Bitcoin (BTC) \"has had a tendency of adding zeroes to its price,\" noting that the asset previously went from $1,000 to $10,000 in less than four years. Maturation may have slowed this trend somewhat, but Bloomberg does not appear to believe it has reached a full stop. They noted that such a rise could occur again, though it may not be for some time:“If the crypto echoes its past gains, with some maturation, about double the time period it took to add a zero to $1,000 could get its price to $100,000 in 2025.”Though this prediction might appear bold on the surface, it is rather conservative compared to other forecasts we\\'ve seen in recent months. A crypto analyst known as \"PlanB,\" has recently stated that Bitcoin is still moving in accordance with the Stock-to-Flow Model, which forecasts a $100,000 price by late 2020.In addition to historical trends, Bloomberg suggests that fundamental supply and demand factors support Bitcoin’s rise.

The biggest obstacle here is a limited transaction processing capacity. Existing blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum are only able to do about 7-10 transactions per second. This technological limitation has been called the blockchain scalability trilemma. If it is solved, blockchain technology can facilitate the creation of a decentralized global currency that can be mass adopted and the implementation of decentralized governance systems, immutable data storage systems, which will improve transparency in governance and monetary policy. Researchers around the world have come up with different proposals for solving the blockchain scalability problem. Sharding is considered to be the most promising. Yet, there is no common vision on how to implement sharding to find the best acceptable compromise among the numerous parameters of the network. Projects such as Ethereum 2.0, Algorand, Cardano, and Zilliqa have developed their own blockchain designs based on sharding. However, all of these projects have a similar pattern in their designs. They all rely on a Proof-of-Stake (PoS) consensus algorithm and pseudo-random selection of validators for shard committees. Jax.Network believes its solution has solved the scalability trilemma and has the potential to become a consumer payment system, unlike other cryptocurrencies that experience delays and failures due to throughput restrictions. Last month, the Jax.Network team participated in the Blockchain.UA conference and shared their vision with the crypto community. Jax.Network is a blockchain platform that follows the JaxNet protocol which issues the world’s first scalable and decentralized stable &#8220;JAX&#8221; coin. Since 2017, its founder Vinod Manoharan has been interested in blockchain and wanted to bring this technology to mass adoption. In 2018, he decided to move to Ukraine to gather a team of technical and scientific experts to solve the blockchain scalability trilemma. Ukraine was the first choice as it has many prominent specialists. With that in mind, Vinod gathered a team, and together they came up with a solution that solves the scalability problem of blockchain networks. The academic paper of JaxNet protocol was published in May 2020. Based on this protocol, Jax.Network solves the blockchain scalability problem using Proof of Work consensus, a universal reward function, sharding, and merged mining. The sharding design used in Jax.Network has multiple advantages. It reduces the storage and network traffic requirements for nodes in the network. It also eliminates the bottleneck of block propagation delay and decreases the volatility of mining rewards. All together, these features have a positive effect on the network scalability and decentralization. In Jax.Network, miners can choose the subset of shards that they want to mine. They can manage their workload according to their computing capabilities. With the blockchain scalability trilemma being solved, Jax.Network aims to create the first truly scalable and stable coin. If this coin is mass adopted, the global financial ecosystem can be changed forever. With that in mind, Jax.Network caters to the payments market and wants to compete with giants like Visa and Mastercard. Right now Jax.Network is at its Proof of Concept stage moving forward according to the roadmap. Eventually, the project wants to transform the organizational systems in the world using blockchain technology. To achieve this, the team has plans to build the necessary infrastructure, including a mining pool, transfer hub, blockchain explorer and API, a crypto wallet &amp; instant messenger.

Charts from Coin Metrics&#x2019; &#x201C;State of the Network: Issue 26&#x201D; were published on November 19, 2019. Just recently, the web portal Blockchaincenter.net published a massive visualization of Bitcoin&#x2019;s circulating supply and distribution. The visual is quite large, but it shows how the existing supply of BTC is distributed among various entities and individuals. For instance, the graphic shows there&#x2019;s 2.6 million BTC on exchanges, which accounts for 12% of the 21 million supply cap. The visualization also estimates there are 1.5 million zombie coins or so-called sleeping bitcoins. Blockchaincenter&#x2019;s graph shows over 328,000 coins are mined every year until the next halving as well. A shortened version of Blockchaincenter.net&#x2019;s 2020 visual graphic. News.Bitcoin.com readers can check out the entire visual here. Grayscale Investments Bitcoin Trust holds 450,000 BTC in reserves and that represents over 2.5% of the outstanding supply of bitcoins today. The chart also shows Microstrategy (38,250 BTC), the 120,000 BTC locked into Ethereum, and Tim Draper&#x2019;s 30,000 BTC stash of old Silk Road coins. The visualization also shows hacks (120k BTC Bitfinex 2016), the Plustoken scam coins (200k BTC), and the 166,000 BTC sitting in Mt Gox wallets today. Blockchaincenter&#x2019;s graphic displays how the current circulating and non-circulating supply is distributed today with a unique visual perspective. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Bitcoin is quite scarce and only 2.5 million are left to mine until 2140, which is the year the last block will be mined into existence. The network is also extremely difficult to mine with the network&#x2019;s difficulty touching 19.22T and the hashrate around 140 exahash per second (EH/s). Moreover, BTC will see a reward halving again on or around May 7, 2024 making the digital currency even more limited by design.

Not only did fears of inflation begin subsiding, but several companies reported strong year-end results and even better outlooks for 2018. The energy industry delivered one of the largest doses of earnings reports, which, along with higher oil prices, helped send several stocks soaring this week. Three that stood out areDenbury Resources(NYSE: DNR),EQT Corp(NYSE: EQT), andDiamondback Energy(NASDAQ: FANG).\nDenbury Resources led this trio higher, with its stock jumping more than 21% this week. While a rebound in the price of oil helped drive that move, the main catalyst was the oil producer's operational update and expectations for 2018. Denbury said that production in the fourth quarter averaged more than 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 1% higher than the third quarter and in line with expectations. The highlight, however, was that Denbury completed a successful exploration well in the Mission Canyon formation of the Cedar Creek Anticline in the Rockies. The well delivered an average of 1,050 barrels of oil per day during its first month, which exceeded expectations. That opened another low-risk, low-cost development area for the company, which gives it the confidence that production will rise 3% this year. That sets the stage for 2018 to \"be a transformative year for Denbury,\" according to CEO Chris Kendall.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nEQT Corp was the next best performer of this group, with its stock bounding 16% in the last week. That's after the country'slargest natural gas producerposted strong fourth-quarter results. Overall, the company reported $167.5 million, or $0.76 per share, in adjusted earnings, which trounced expectations by a whopping $0.52 per share. A 23% improvement in commodity prices, when combined with a 17% increase in volumes, helped fuel the earnings beat. Meanwhile, the company expects to continue growing production at a rapid rate in 2018, with it planning for another 17% increase fully funded by internally generated cash flow at current commodity prices. Further, the company noted that it expected to approve a plan to address thecontinued discount in its stock price and the value of its assetsby the end of this month.\nDiamondback Energy rounded out the trio by rising 14% this week, continuing itsmarket-crushingrunover the past few years.

The Motley Fool has adisclosure policy. || After a turbulent start to the month, the stock market bounced back sharply this week, taking most stocks with it. Not only did fears of inflation begin subsiding, but several companies reported strong year-end results and even better outlooks for 2018. The energy industry delivered one of the largest doses of earnings reports, which, along with higher oil prices, helped send several stocks soaring this week. Three that stood out are Denbury Resources (NYSE: DNR) , EQT Corp (NYSE: EQT) , and Diamondback Energy (NASDAQ: FANG) . Bounding with optimism Denbury Resources led this trio higher, with its stock jumping more than 21% this week. While a rebound in the price of oil helped drive that move, the main catalyst was the oil producer's operational update and expectations for 2018. Denbury said that production in the fourth quarter averaged more than 61,000 barrels of oil equivalent per day, which was 1% higher than the third quarter and in line with expectations. The highlight, however, was that Denbury completed a successful exploration well in the Mission Canyon formation of the Cedar Creek Anticline in the Rockies. The well delivered an average of 1,050 barrels of oil per day during its first month, which exceeded expectations. That opened another low-risk, low-cost development area for the company, which gives it the confidence that production will rise 3% this year. That sets the stage for 2018 to \"be a transformative year for Denbury,\" according to CEO Chris Kendall. Oil pump during a beautiful golden sunrise. Image source: Getty Images. EQT Corp was the next best performer of this group, with its stock bounding 16% in the last week. That's after the country's largest natural gas producer posted strong fourth-quarter results. Overall, the company reported $167.5 million, or $0.76 per share, in adjusted earnings, which trounced expectations by a whopping $0.52 per share. A 23% improvement in commodity prices, when combined with a 17% increase in volumes, helped fuel the earnings beat. Meanwhile, the company expects to continue growing production at a rapid rate in 2018, with it planning for another 17% increase fully funded by internally generated cash flow at current commodity prices. Further, the company noted that it expected to approve a plan to address the continued discount in its stock price and the value of its assets by the end of this month. Story continues Diamondback Energy rounded out the trio by rising 14% this week, continuing its market-crushing run over the past few years. Like EQT Corp, stronger-than-expected fourth-quarter results fueled Diamondback's most recent surge. In the oil driller's case, it posted a profit of $1.56 per share, which beat expectations by $0.05 per share thanks to a 9% increase in production during the quarter, pushing output up a jaw-dropping 79% over the past year.

Keeping its foot on the gas It's possible to make the case that all three of these oil and gas stocks could continue heading higher this year. That said, the one that seems to have the most room to run is EQT Corp. That's because the company owns a valuable midstream business that the market doesn't give it much credit for holding.

The Motley Fool has a disclosure policy . || Warren Buffett's famous for his stock-picking prowess, so when he decides it's time to sell a stock inBerkshire Hathaway's(NYSE: BRK-B)(NYSE: BRK-A)portfolio, it's probably worth paying attention. Fortunately, a big investor like Buffett has to file a quarterly 13F report with the SEC showing exactly what he's been selling, and his latest filing shows he's unloading shares ofIBM(NYSE: IBM)andGeneral Motors(NYSE: GM). Should you give up on these blue chip stocks, too?\nIBM is hoping to return to growth with its strategic-imperatives businesses, which sell solutions for high-growth markets including cloud computing. Unfortunately, the headway it's making in these areas has struggled to offset declining demand for its legacy products and services and that's landed IBM in Buffett's cross-hairs.\nImage source: The Motley Fool.\nDespitedouble-digit growthin its strategic-imperatives sales in 2017, IBM's companywide revenue still fell 1% to $79.1 billion and its adjusted earnings declined to $13.80 per share from $13.59 in 2016 and $14.92 in 2015.\nIBM's inability to more quickly offset revenue and profit headwinds caused Buffett to begin selling shares early last year. In Q1 2017 he sold 17 million shares of IBM, leaving him with 64.5 million shares remaining on March 31, 2017. Since then, he's continued to sell shares and according to his recent 13F report, Berkshire Hathaway finished December ...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: no_data\n- Bitcoin News: no_data\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): Earn money by mining for Bitcoin, US Dollar, Monero or Ethereum.

Three hot digital currencies -- Ripple and lesser-known Cardano and Stellar -- are surging today on major investor interest. Here are the latest cryptocurrency prices and how much each has changed recently.\nHere's a look at the largest cryptocurrencies by market capitalization, and how much each has changed over the past day as well as over the past week.\n[{\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Bitcoin (BTC)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$14,795\", \"Day's Change\": \"(1.6%)\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(3.8%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Ripple (XRP)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$2.78\", \"Day's Change\": \"27.4%\", \"7-Day Change\": \"130.8%\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Ethereum (ETH)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$919.77\", \"Day's Change\": \"8.3%\", \"7-Day Change\": \"19.1%\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Bitcoin Cash (BCH)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$2,550.00\", \"Day's Change\": \"(2.1%)\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(8%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Cardano (ADA)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$1.04\", \"Day's Change\": \"36.5%\", \"7-Day Change\": \"155.1%\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Stellar (XLM)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$0.89\", \"Day's Change\": \"58.8%\", \"7-Day Change\": \"301.7%\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Litecoin (LTC)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$245.10\", \"Day's Change\": \"(3.2%)\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(10.3%)\"}]\nData Source: investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of 3:10 p.m. EST on Jan. 3, 2018, and prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate.\nThere have been several big cryptocurrency moves in just the past 24 hours, but none involving bitcoin, Ethereum, bitcoin cash, or litecoin. After rising yesterday on news that Peter Thiel hasinvested millionsin the leading digital currency, bitcoin has been relatively flat, but Ripple has achieved another all-time high, and now has a market cap equal to roughly half of bitcoin.\nAdditionally, Cardano and Stellar jumped by 37% and 59%, respectively, pushing litecoin, which was once a top alternative digital currency, all the way down to the number seven position. These two lesser-known currencies have been on fire lately, as they aim to solve some of theobstacles to bitcoinbeing used on a large scale as a money-transfer mechanism.\nCardano has surged to a market value of nearly $30 billion thanks to investor interest in its scalable and uniquely secure blockchain network. And Stellar, like Ripple, has become the subject of investor interest for its high-profile corporate partnerships.\nStellar has been the best-performing cryptocurrency of 2018, with a gain of roughly 150% through the first three days of the year, including nearly 60% in the past day. The lesser-known currency has catapulted over litecoin to become the sixth-largest cryptocurrency by market cap as of this writing, with a total market value of about $16.4 billion.\nImage source: Getty Images.\nStellar was originally based on Ripple's protocol (both companies have the same founder, Jed McCaleb), but was later completely redone. And to be clear, Stellar is the name of the protocol. Its currency is officially called the lumen, with symbol XLM. And like Ripple, the main reason for the surge in interest in the currency is that it has shown real-world traction toward becoming a widely used payment medium.\nMost notably,IBMispartnering with Stellarto develop a rapid, international payments system. Like Ripple, Stellar solves some of the key problems facing bitcoin, especially rising transaction fees and long transaction times, both of which have become worse as bitcoin has surged in popularity.\nRelated Video:\nWatch original series, sports, and more ongo90.\nMore From The Motley Fool\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

More information about each potential case can be found at the link provided. Arcimoto, Inc. (NASDAQ: FUV) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Arcimoto following a class action complaint that was filed against Arcimoto on April 19, 2021. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made false and/or misleading statements and/or failed to disclose that: (1) the preorders of Arcimotos Fun Utility Vehicles (FUVs) were fabricated or never completed, with only 19 units delivered out of an alleged preorder of 422; (2) Arcimoto failed to disclose to customers that nearly 100% of its vehicles delivered were under safety recall; (3) Arcimotos largest customer, R-Key-Moto, was an undisclosed related party owned by insider FOD Capital, LLC; (4) Arcimotos partnership with HULA was an undisclosed related party transaction; and (5) as a result, defendants public statements were materially false and/or misleading at all relevant times.

According to a complaint filed against the Company, Arrays IPO Materials stated that one of the Companys strengths related to its management of costs. Specifically, the Offering Materials noted the Company's [d]emonstrated ability to reduce the cost of our products while increasing profit margins and that its [r]igorous supply chain management [was] supported by a sophisticated enterprise resource planning (ERP) system. With regard to strategy, the IPO Materials explained how the Company leveraged its global supply chain and economies of scale to reduce product cost. However, the Company failed to disclose the then-existing rise of costs related to certain supplies such as steel, as well as the Company's freight costs. Story continues On May 11, 2021, Array reported lower revenues year-over-year and lower margins. These dismal financial results included a 44% decrease in revenue for the prior year period, a 63% decrease in gross profit, a 69% decrease in adjusted EBITDA, and 71% decrease in adjusted income. The Company blamed increased steel and shipping costs, and noted, continuing increases in prices of steel and freight costs will impact our margins in the second quarter and potentially subsequent quarters if prices do not normalize. To learn more about our investigation into Array go to: https://bespc.com/cases/ARRY Renewable Energy Group, Inc. (NASDAQ: REGI) Bragar Eagel & Squire is investigating certain officers and directors of Renewable Energy Group, Inc. following a class action complaint that was filed against Renewable Energy on March 2, 2021. The complaint alleges that throughout the Class Period defendants made materially false and/or misleading statements, as well as failed to disclose material adverse facts about the Companys business, operations, and prospects. Specifically, defendants failed to disclose to investors: (1) that due to failures in the diesel additive system, petroleum diesel was not periodically added to certain loads by the Company and was instead added by the Companys customers; (2) that, as a result, Renewable Energy was not the proper claimant for certain BTC payments on biodiesel it sold between January 1, 2017 and September 30, 2020; (3) that, as a result, Renewable Energys revenue and net income were overstated for certain periods; (4) that there was a material weakness in the Companys internal control over financial reporting related to the purchase and use of the petroleum diesel gallons when blending with biodiesel; and (5) that, as a result of the foregoing, defendants positive statements about the Companys business, operations, and prospects were materially misleading and/or lacked a reasonable basis.

The movement in the next few days will be crucial in determining the future trend.\nDuring the week of June 28-July 5, BTC did not move significantly in either direction. On the contrary, it ranged between $32,699 and $36,660. It’s still trading above the long-term horizontal support level of $32,600, and has created several long lower wicks below it.\nHowever, technical indicators in the weekly time frame are still bearish. The MACD is negative, the RSI has crossed below 50, and the Stochastic oscillator has made a bearish cross.\nThe daily chart shows that BTC has been trading inside a range between $31,400 and $40,550 since May 19. The latter is also the 0.382 Fib retracement resistance level and could coincide with a descending resistance line, depending on when it’s reached.\nBTC bounced at the support area on June 22, created a higher low on June 26, and has been moving upwards since.\nHowever, technical indicators are not bullish yet. The MACD signal line is negative and the RSI is below 50. However, both are increasing.\nIn addition to this, the Stochastic oscillator is very close to making a bullish cross (green circle).\nThere are two potential wave counts in play.\nThe bearish count suggests that BTC is still in a bearish impulse, one that has been ongoing since the all-time high of $64,895 from April 14.\nIf the count is correct, BTC would currently be in sub-wave two (black) of wave five (orange).\nA potential target for the bottom of the move is found near $19,800.\nBTC completed sub-wave two (red) yesterday near the 0.786 Fib retracement resistance level of $33,800. It failed to reach the middle of the channel and broke down instead.\nTherefore, for the count to remain valid, BTC would have to break down from the channel soon with a sharp downward movement.\nThe bullish count indicates that the upward movement is aleading diagonalinstead. In this case, BTC would reach a high near $37,500, before breaking down.\nNevertheless, the increase would be a part of wave A (orange) of an A-B-C corrective structure, indicating that the local low is already in.\nWhether BTC breaks down from the current support or bounces will likely determine the future trend.\nFor BeInCrypto’s previousbitcoin(BTC) analysis,click here.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":63,\"stop_loss\":40330.77,\"take_profit\":45302.23,\"forecast_10d\":[43798.12, 46365.40, 45585.03, 45593.64, 44428.29, 47793.32, 47096.95, 47047.00, 46004.48, 44695.36]}"}

Partially reversing a 4.30% slide from Thursday, Bitcoin ended the day at $33,816.0. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning intraday high $33,983.0 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $34,842, Bitcoin fell to a mid-morning intraday low $32,700.0. Steering clear of the first major support level at $32,493, however, Bitcoin revisited $33,900 levels before easing back. The near-term bullish trend remained intact in spite of the latest slide back to sub-$30,000 levels. For the bears, Bitcoin would need a sustained fall through the 62% FIB of $27,237 to form a near-term bearish trend. The Rest of the Pack Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day on Friday. Cardano’s ADA rallied by 4.75% to lead the way, with Chainlink (+0.17%) and Ethereum (+2.29%) also joining Bitcoin in the green. It was a bearish day for the rest of the majors, however. Bitcoin Cash SV (-1.43%) and Crypto.com Coin (-1.24%) led the way down. Binance Coin (-0.12%), Litecoin (-0.09%), Polkadot (-0.13%), and Ripple’s XRP (-0.34%) saw relatively modest losses, however. In the current week, the crypto total market rose to a Tuesday high $1,485bn before falling to a Friday low $1,319bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,376bn. Bitcoin’s dominance rose to a Monday high 47.67% before falling to a Thursday low 45.54%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 45.94%. This Morning At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.26% to 33,727.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning high $33,942.0 before falling to a low $33,716.0. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day. Crypto.com Coin bucked the trend early on, rising by 1.89%. It was a bearish start for the rest of the majors, however. At the time of writing, Cardano’s ADA was down by 0.65% to lead the way down. Story continues For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to avoid the $33,500 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $34,299 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $34,000 levels. Barring a broad-based crypto rebound, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside. In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $35,000 levels before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $34,783. A fall through the $33,500 pivot would bring the first major support level at $33,016 into play. Barring another extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$32,000 levels. The second major support level at $32,217 should limit the downside.

In recent trading, the price of BTC was at $34,738, up 3.58% in the last 24 hours. Before the reduction in mining difficulty, BTC was about $33,700.\nRelated:Bitcoin Holds Support; Faces Resistance at $36K\nCharlie Morris, CIO of ByteTree Asset Management, tweeted hours after the difficulty cut that fees had dropped to $6 from $10 yesterday.\nThe adjustment marks the third straight decline in mining difficulty, the first time such a trend has happened since December 2018. On May 29 and June 13, the mining difficulty dropped by 16% and 5%, respectively, according to mining service provider BTC.com.\nBitcoin’s difficulty is measured using an internal score that began at 1 (when Satoshi started mining at the easiest level). It is programmed to increase or decrease incrementally depending on how many miners are competing on the network. It is currently scored at 14,363,025,673,659, down from 19,932,791,027,262.\nBlocks are added to the Bitcoin blockchain at a regular and predictable rate: one block every 10 minutes or so. Block time measures how long it takes to create a new block, but that pace can vary, depending on the number of miners on the network and the speed of their computers. When there are more miners competing to “find” the next block, and earn the 6.125 BTC reward, then those blocks tend to be solved more quickly. However, when miners drop off the network, leaving fewer miners to compete, block times can slow down.\nRelated:Ransomware Group REvil Strikes Again, Demands $70M in Bitcoin From 200 US Firms\nThat’s what happened as Chinese authoritiespushed to tamp downcryptocurrency trading and mining, since the country has historically hostedsuch a large portionof the Bitcoin network’s hashpower. Local authorities in China’sXinjiang Uygur Autonomous Region, the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region,Qinghai provinceandSichuan provincefollowed the top-down initiative by announcing plans toshut downsome or allbitcoinmines.\nDuring this most recent difficulty period, the mean hashrate, a measure of total computational power contributed to the blockchain through mining, stood at 87.7 exahashes per second, the lowest since December 2019. That’s down from about a peak of about 180 exahashes per second in mid-May.\nAs a result, Bitcoin’s mean block time slowed significantly, with some blocks taking as long as 23 minutes on Sunday, June 27, though the network appears to have sped up slightly since then.\nThe Bitcoin algorithm is programmed to self-adjust the difficulty level every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every two weeks, in order to maintain a target block time of 10 minutes.\nSo that’s what happened overnight, as the blockchain’s automatic stabilizer mechanism kicked in to incentivize more miners to join the network.\nToday’s difficulty drop will make it easier for the remaining miners to find blocks at a rate closer to the 10-minute target.\nThough a decline in Bitcoin’s hashrate means it is slightly less resilient against atta...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: no_data\n- Bitcoin News: no_data\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): no_data\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nAs we start the current week of trading, inflation stocks appear to be on investors’ minds. For the uninitiated, this part of thestock marketconsists of stocks that perform well or show resilience during inflation. If anything, the economy has and continues to perform exceptionally as it recovers towards pre-pandemic levels. So much so that core inflation markers are starting to lean towards record highs. Just last week, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) surged by 5% year-over-year, its fastest pace since August 2008. For one thing, the rise in the cost of goods and services would stand to affect consumers and businesses alike.\nIn cases like this, some would argue that investors would be wise to add some inflation stocks to their portfolios. Namely, billionaire hedge fund managerPaul Tudor Jonessaid just that in an interview with CNBC earlier today. According to Jones, investors should “go all-in on inflation trades” should the Federal Reserve (Fed) remain unconcerned with rising consumer prices. While watching the Fed ahead of its policy meeting this week, he highlighted commodities,cryptocurrency, and gold. As such, it would not surprise me to see more conservative investors looking for the top inflation stocks now.\nFor instance, commodity-based companies such as Freeport-McMoRan (NYSE: FCX) continue to prosper amidst rising material costs. Aside from commodities, the current market would also favor cryptocurrency players like MicroStrategy (NASDAQ: MSTR) as the dollar potentially weakens. As it stands, both companies’ shares are currently looking at gains of over 275% in the past year. If you are looking to add some defensive inflation plays to your watchlist now, here are four making waves in thestock market today.\n• Marathon Digital Holdings Inc.(NASDAQ: MARA)\n• NVIDIA Corporation(NASDAQ: NVDA)\n• Newmont Corporation(NYSE: NEM)\n• Riot Blockchain Inc.(NASDAQ: RIOT)\nMarathon is a digital asset technology company that mines cryptocurrencies. Specifically, it focuses on the blockchain ecosystem and the generation of digital assets. The company currently operates its proprietary data center in Hardin MT with a maximum power capacity of 105 Megawatts. MARA stock currently trades at $31.20 as of 12:22 p.m. ET and has been up by over 17% on today’s opening bell. Investors could be responding to Elon Musk’s comments saying that Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA) will use bitcoin when mining is done with more clean energy.\nEarlier in the month, the company provided a Bitcoin production and mining operation update for May 2021. Impressively, the company produced 226.6 newly minted bitcoins in May, increasing total holdings to approximately 5,518 with a fair market value of approximately $203.4 million. It also ended the month with approximately $191.8 million in cash and total liquidity was approximately $395.1 million.\nIt has also received approximately 16,809 S-19 Pro ASIC miners from Bitmain year-to-date with an additional 1,911 units currently in transit. The company has also increased its active mining fleet to approximately 17,655 miners, generating approximately 1.9 EH/s. For these reasons, will you consider adding MARA stock to your portfolio?\n[Read More]4 Semiconductor Stocks To Watch Right Now\nNvidia is a semiconductor company that has essentially pioneered the graphics processing unit (GPU) market. Its products and platforms are used for the large, growing markets of gaming, professional visualization, data center, and automotive industries. NVDA stock currently trades at $719.04 as of 12:22 p.m. ET. On May 31, 2021, the company announced its latest gaming flagship, the GeForce RTX 3080 Ti and RTX 3070 Ti GPU.\nIt is 1.5x faster than the previous generation and is priced at very competitive rates. Powered by the Nvidia Ampere architecture, the RTX 3080 Ti delivers an incredible leap in performance and fidelity with acclaimed features like ray tracing and Nvidia’s DLSS performance-boosting AI. Also, in late May, the company announced record first-quarter financials. Firstly, the company posted record revenue of $5.66 billion, up by 84% year-over-year.\nA huge chunk of this revenue came from its gaming and data center segments at $2.76 billion and $2.05 billion respectively. Gaming revenue more than doubled year-over-year while data center revenue increased by 79% in that same period. With so many exciting things happening to the company, is NVDA stock a top inflation stock to consider buying?\n[Read More]4 Artificial Intelligence Stocks To Watch Right Now\nNewmont is one of the largest gold mining companies in the world. It has ownership of gold mines in Nevada, Ontario, Argentina, and Ghana among others. Aside from gold, it is also a producer of copper, silver, zinc, and lead. Impressively, it is also the only gold producer listed in the S&P 500 Index and is an industry leader in value creation. NEM Stock currently trades at $69.47 as of 12:22 p.m. ET.\nIn May, the company announced that it had completed the acquisition of GT Gold Corporation. “With the acquisition of GT Gold and the Tatogga project in the highly sought-after Golden Triangle district of British Columbia, Canada, Newmont continues to strengthen our world-class portfolio,” said Newmont President and CEO Tom Palmer.\nThe acquisition of the Tatogga project has the potential to contribute to future significant gold and copper annual production for the company. There could also be further exploration opportunities within the land package. All things considered, will you buy NEM stock?\n[Read more]Best Stocks To Invest In 2021? 3 Cyclical Stocks To Watch\nNext up, we have Riot Blockchain Inc. For some context, the company is primarily in the business of mining Bitcoin. As such, Riot is constantly looking to expand and upgrade its mining operations. Similar to gold stocks, cryptocurrency stocks like RIOT stock would be in focus when inflation is running high. Evidently, that appears to be the case today as RIOT stock is up by over 19% on Monday and currently trades at $37.05 as of 12:23 p.m. ET. Would now be the time to jump on RIOT stock?\nWell, if anything, Riot remains as busy as ever on the operational front. Just last week, the company wowed investors with its May 2021 Bitcoin production update. Impressively, Riot produced 227 bitcoins throughout the month, marking a 220% year-over-year surge. On top of that, Riot continues to expand its mining operations in the U.S. as well. In late May, the company completed its acquisition of Whinstone U.S.’ Bitcoin mining facility in Rockdale, Texas.\nAccording to Riot, it is currently the largest Bitcoin mining facility in North America. Overall, the company appears to be firing on all cylinders while also finding new ways to significantly expand its portfolio. Would this make RIOT stock a top buy for you now?\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":37,\"stop_loss\":31387.47,\"take_profit\":36406.62,\"forecast_10d\":[35287.78, 33746.00, 34235.20, 33855.33, 32877.37, 33798.01, 33520.52, 34240.19, 33155.85, 32702.03]}"}

Partially reversing a 3.13% gain from Friday, Bitcoin ended the day at $10,196.9. It was a mixed start to the day. Bitcoin rose to an early morning intraday high $10,593.0 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $10,764, Bitcoin slid to a late intraday low $9,925.5. Bitcoin fell through the first major support level at $10,086 before finding late support. Late in the day, Bitcoin moved back through the first major support level to wrap up the day at $10,190 levels. The near-term bullish trend remained intact, in spite of the latest pullback to sub-$10,000. For the bears, Bitcoin would need to slide through the 62% FIB of $6,400 to form a near-term bearish trend. The Rest of the Pack Across the rest of the majors, it was a mixed day for the majors on Saturday. Tron’s TRX and Ethereum tumbled by 15.96% and by 13.69% respectively to lead the way down. Binance Coin (-7.32%), Cardano’s ADA (-11.59%), Ripple’s XRP (-6.62%), Stellar’s Lumen (-7.32%), and Tezos (-9.61%) also saw particularly heavy losses. Bitcoin Cash ABC (-5.07%), EOS (-2.02%), Litecoin (-5.77%), and Monero’s XMR (-5.98%) saw relatively modest losses. Bitcoin Cash SV bucked the trend on the day, rising by 0.25%. In the current week, the crypto total market rose to a Tuesday high $379.05bn before sliding to a Saturday low $279.73bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $306.87bn. Bitcoin’s dominance fell to a Wednesday low 58.79% before rising to a Saturday high 61.97%. At the time of writing, Bitcoin’s dominance stood at 61.36%. This Morning At the time of writing, Bitcoin was up by 0.23% to $10,220.0. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin fall to an early morning low $10,147.0 before rising to a high $10,225.0. Bitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. Elsewhere, it was a mixed start to the day. Bianance Coin (-0.79%) and Tezos (-0.56%) saw red early on. Story continues It was a bullish start for the rest of the majors, however. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash SV was up by 2.24% to lead the way early on. For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move through the $10,239 pivot level to support a run at the first major resistance level at $10,551. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $10,500 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Saturday’s high $10,593.0 would likely cap any upside. In the event of a crypto breakout, the second major resistance level at $10,906 would likely come into play. Failure to move through the $10,239 pivot would bring the first major support level at $9,884 into play. Barring another extended crypto sell-off, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of the second major support level at $9,571.

Professional traders watch this moving average closely and it is generally considered that if the price stays above it, the trend remains positive.Crypto market data daily view. Source: Coin360Usually, every sharp fall is followed by a rebound because aggressive traders use the dip to buy. However, the bears who could not sell in the first fall wait to sell on relief rallies. If the next drop breaks below the recent lows, then it will suggest the start of a deeper correction.Conversely, if the bulls can defend the recent lows and sustain the rebound, it will suggest that the correction might be over. The cryptocurrencies selected in this analysis are all trading above their 200-day SMAs and are attempting a rebound off their recent lows.As the correction has been sharp, traders should watch the price action carefully before initiating any long positions.BTC/USDBitcoin has failed to rebound sharply from the $10,000 level in the past three days, which suggests that the bears are selling on every relief rally. This suggests that the sentiment has turned from buy on dips to sell on rallies.BTC/USD daily chart.

Opium founder, Andrey Belyakov, claims the product is the &#x201C;first CDS (credit default swap) on a centralized stablecoin.&#x201D; The stablecoin tether (USDT) is the most popular dollar-pegged token out there today, as it captures a large market cap and significant trade volume. Tether&#x2019;s market valuation is around $14.1 billion and the token has around $13.6 billion in global trade volume on Sunday afternoon. In addition to the stablecoin&#x2019;s popularity, being number one comes with significant criticism. Over the last few years, a number of people have speculated on whether or not tether (USDT) is backed by real dollars. Especially given the fact that roughly $10 billion worth of the market cap grew in 2020. In the spring of 2019, court documents revealed that every tether was supported by &#x201C;cash and cash equivalents.&#x201D; The founder of the Opium Protocol, Andrey Belyakov, says his team has designed a credit default swap (CDS) on USDT. The new CDS will allow users to protect their investment in USDT or even bet against the controversial stablecoin. &#x201C;Opium Protocol is proud to announce the very first CDS (Credit Default Swap) on a centralized stablecoin &#x2014; USDT,&#x201D; Belyakov detailed in a blog post. Belyakov further added: You can use it to protect yourself against (or speculate on) a systemic failure of the most widely used stablecoin in crypto. It also allows you to earn interest on your capital in case you are willing to bet on the quality and sustainability of USDT. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Belyakov explained that financial products like derivatives are perfect for centralized stablecoins and &#x201C;CDSs are used to insure against credit default events.&#x201D; The Opium founder notes that these centralized stablecoins can be defined as &#x201C;credit notes.&#x201D; &#x201C;For example, USDC can be regarded as a credit issued by Coinbase, GUSD is issued by Gemini and USDT is issued by a firm called Tether, which is closely associated with Bitfinex,&#x201D; Belyakov details. The Opium founder highlights that USDT in particular has been scrutinized over the company&#x2019;s reserve status. Belyakov also reveals the project will leverage Chainlink&#x2019;s price oracle tied to the USDT-USD price and he believes the product will be a great tool for risk management going forward. &#x201C;[Opium Protocol is] using a decentralized Chainlink price oracle to trigger the derivative logic in the most reliable way,&#x201D; Belyakov concludes. &#x201C;At maturity, a USDT-USD price oracle is used to determine whether the market price of USDT is still on a peg or has fallen below $0.95 USD &#x2014; which would pay out the collateral to the CDS buyer. For example, if USDT is traded at 70 cents per dollar at maturity the CDS holder will receive 30 cents per dollar to compensate for a loss.&#x201D; What do you think about the Opium Protocol&#x2019;s new crypto derivatives product tied to the stablecoin tether?

The U.S. citizen becomes the second person to plead guilty to charges relating to the scam after Romanian Silviu Catalin Balaci&#8217;s admission in July. Abel was initially charged by indictment in December 2019 along with four other co-defendants soon after their arrest.

From April 2014 through to December 2019, Abel and his accomplices operated the scheme which specifically targeted &#8220;dumb&#8221; investors. The operation, which grew to become one of the largest crypto Ponzi schemes, targeted countries in Asia, Africa, and Europe.

COVID-19 Brings New Opportunity: Cuban also talked about how the COVID-19 pandemic could create opportunities for entrepreneurs and the NBA bubble. The \"Shark Tank\" host remarked that the lockdown situation is forcing people to adapt to a digital lifestyle. He claimed that these troubled times is the perfect and opportune moment for creative and innovative entrepreneurs with a vision for the future. Back in April, Cuban claimed that despite having a hopeful long term opinion, he held a bleak view of the US market rally in the short run.

The immediate support on the downside is at the moving averages. If the price rebounds off the 20-day exponential moving average ($56,387), the bulls will make one more attempt to push the price above $58,966.53.BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewIf they succeed, the BTC/USDT pair could start its journey toward the resistance line of the ascending channel at $67,000. The price has turned down from the resistance line on two previous occasions, hence the bears will again try to defend this level. The momentum will pick up after the buyers push the price above the channel.However, the flattish moving averages and the relative strength index close to the midpoint show a lack of bullish momentum. If the bears pull the price below the 20-day EMA, the pair could drop to $52,323.21.A strong rebound off this level will suggest buying at lower levels and that could result in a range-bound action between $52,323.21 and $58,966.53 for a few days. On the other contrary, a break below $52,323.21 may open the doors for a fall to the support line of the ascending channel and then to $46,985 where buyers may step in to arrest the decline.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows the bears are defending the $58,966.53 overhead resistance. If they can sink the price below the 50-simple moving average, the pair could drop to $55,000 and then to $52,323.21.The flattish moving averages and the RSI near the midpoint suggest a balance between supply and demand.

The government has identified a record number of websites trying to obtain login details from crypto exchange users. Over 30 sites have been taken down in just three months this year. Seoul Strengthens Monitoring of Crypto Phishing Scams Rising market prices have led to an increased number of phishing attempts targeting investors and users of cryptocurrency in South Korea. The government in Seoul announced it&#x2019;s strengthening its monitoring system to quickly detect such threats. It will also work closely with the Korean National Police Agency (KNPA) to prevent fraud. The Korean Ministry of Science and Information and Communications Technology said it&#x2019;s receiving an increasing number of reports of phishing attempts. Attacks are often conducted via text messages convincing crypto traders to enter their exchange usernames and passwords on fake websites. The perpetrators can then access their accounts and steal their holdings. The department has found and blocked 32 phishing websites only in the past three months, Yonhap News Agency reported. That compares to a total of 41 sites identified during the whole 2020. Fake web pages often have domain names that look similar to those of real platforms. One of them is called Bithnub, a misspelled version of the name of one of the largest Korean exchanges, Bithumb. The monitoring system operated by the ICT ministry works around the clock to block such websites as soon as possible. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Police Agency Investigates 21 Cases of Breached Crypto Accounts Meanwhile, the National Police Agency has opened its own front against crypto fraud since early March this year, the Korean Herald revealed in an article. KNPA is now investigating 21 cases in which accounts of cryptocurrency users have been breached and emptied of assets. The agency recently prohibited its own investigators from acquiring cryptocurrencies and obliged them to disclose any coins purchased before the ban. A recent report revealed that South Koreans have access to more trading platforms and types of digital currencies than other nations such as Japan and the U.S. In April, the price of the leading cryptocurrency by market capitalization, BTC, reached 80 million won per coin in Korea (around $72,000). The high market prices have led to a spike in other illegal activities involving digital assets. This week, the Korean police raided the offices of a Seoul-based cryptocurrency exchange suspected of defrauding customers through a multi-level marketing scheme. Korean financial regulators have announced an offensive against crypto-related money laundering and fraud which will continue until June.

During the show, Musk mentioned cryptocurrency and dogecoin several times. The first mention was during his monologue when his mother, Maye, joined him. &#8220;I&#8217;m excited for my Mother&#8217;s Day gift. I just hope it&#8217;s not dogecoin,&#8221; she told her son. The Spacex CEO replied: &#8220;It is.

Che proceeded to ask the expert, &#8220;What are cryptocurrencies?&#8221; Musk responded as Lloyd Ostertag: They are a type of digital money. But, instead of being controlled by a central government, they are decentralized using blockchain technology &#8230; And lately, prices have been soaring for cryptos like bitcoin, ethereum, and especially dogecoin. During the SNL show, DOGE did not pump, however. In fact, the price of the meme cryptocurrency fell almost 30% to about 43 cents before bouncing back slightly, according to data from markets.Bitcoin.com. Crypto trading app Robinhood also experienced an outage during that time, possibly due to heavy DOGE selloffs. The firm said that the outage only lasted less than an hour.

I\\'m not so convinced.', 44, '2021-05-09 00:25', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/chia/comments/n8029n/is_chia_really_green_im_not_so_convinced/', 'I\\'m hopefully that Chia will become a viable cryptocurrency like ETH and BTC, and initially I was happy to see that there is a focus on reducing energy consumption. But I personally don\\'t think we can call Chia \"green\" yet, and here are a few reasons why (and things I think the founders &amp; devs need to solve for if they truly want a \"green\" cryptocurrency)...\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n1. **The bullish economics of crypto-mining** \\\\-- What they have created is a pure competition system; you have a chance of winning XCH while farming, yes, but as anyone has watched since the mainnet went live, the network space is growing so fast that unless you\\'re burning through 20 plots per day, there is no way you can keep up with the growth. This means we\\'re using:\\n   1. *Energy in Phase 1 with 100% CPU cycles*, and most modern multi-threaded procs use as much energy as a video card mining ETH. Yes, it\\'s definitely less than ETH mining, but plotting at 6 hours / plot with a 2 hour Phase 1 in parallel means you\\'re still using about 8 hours of energy per day at 200W+ depending on your processor. \\n   2. *Energy usage in the supply chain* \\\\-- we all know about the chip shortage right now, and some chip foundries are even having issues sourcing the actual silicon itself. This may right itself after Covid dies down some (assuming it does die down) and supply chains stabilize, but think about the amount of energy that goes into building both SSDs and HDDs. Chia is likely to increase demand, and thus the amount of end-to-end energy required to make Chia run will increase, as will the demand on the natural resources that make up SSDs and HDDs. This wouldn\\'t be as big a deal if Chia wasn\\'t so hard on SSDs and didn\\'t take up so much space on HDDs, but both are true, so we\\'ll constantly have to churn out SSDs and HDDs to keep up.\\n2. Compared to Proof of Stake (which I acknowledge may not be as secure), the energy usage looking at point #1 is far higher. With POS, you\\'re \"farming\" in a similar way to Chia, but using an already existing coin as your \"plot\" and getting more coins as a reward (which creates liquidity since they\\'re new coins) for holding your coin as a validator rather than exchanging it. \\n3. The reward halving is probably far too long a period to cause this plotting frenzy to end, which means the energy usage is going to continue probably for the next three years, assuming SDD and HDD manufacturers can keep up and don\\'t run into supply chain issues. Maybe we\\'ll see plotting taper off, but I honestly doubt it when the world is so crypto-mad right now. \\n\\nI think in a developer\\'s ideal eye, Chia seemed green, but I also think the developers didn\\'t fully realize just how much demand would come from the crypto-whales who don\\'t really know a limit to their greed (or they did and created a new coin fully realizing that that is the best way to make money from crypto--make your own coin!). As it stands, though, I think it has a long way to go before it is truly a \"green\" and sustainable currency. Chia is incredibly wasteful when you look at the resources needed to keep the network going--and we\\'re only a week in. \\n\\n**Imagine just how much space is going to be used by this time next year.** That\\'s space that could have been used for lots of other potentially more useful things other than just sitting there hoping you have a hash that matches the current farming challenge. Plotting also takes more overall hardware to be viable. With things like ETH or BTC, you can just get an ASIC or a good graphics card (if you can find them) on a crap machine and make a tidy profit. With XCH, you need a good mobo with PCI-E 4.0 and multiple NVME slots for the fastest plotting (or good server hardware), as well as a high-thread-count CPU for Phase 1. That\\'s a lot of extra parts to source, and way more burden on the supply chains that have to provide them. \\n\\nAnyway, it\\'s not my intent to push any buttons or start any flame wars, but I felt like I needed to at least get my thoughts out there since I personally have some issues with Chia being called \"green\" in its current state. It doesn\\'t seem very green at all to me. It\\'s seems more like a clever workaround for the current shortage of ETH compatible GPUs and BTC ASICs.  \\n\\nThat said, I\\'m going to put my hypocrite hat on and go back to my non-stop plotting :)', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/chia/comments/n8029n/is_chia_really_green_im_not_so_convinced/', 'n8029n', [['u/speedmann', 11, '2021-05-09 00:35', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/chia/comments/n8029n/is_chia_really_green_im_not_so_convinced/gxfon2y/', 'And here we go again.

A small amount of people is getting crazy to \"get the most out of chia while it\\'s small\" but it does not really make a difference if you plot 1 or 100 plots per day once the netspace becomes big (I\\'d say it is already neglectable with the current space).

The latest reversal saw mortgage rates fall to the lowest level since the end of January last year. The figures were released by Freddie Mac . Following the weekly slide, 30-year fixed rates stood 13 basis points below levels from 12-months ago. Since the most recent peak at mid-November of last year, 30-year fixed rates have fallen by 63 basis points. Of greater significance is that fact the mortgage rates fell to their lowest level of the current year. Economic Data from the Week Economic data out of the U.S through the week was on the heavier side. Key stats included January retail sales and February inflation numbers. While retail sales were on the rise in January, a sizeable reversal to December numbers pointed to a softer 4 th quarter GDP number. February inflation figures were also skewed to the negative, with the core annual rate of inflation softening from 2.2% to 2.1%. Durable goods orders released on Wednesday also painted a less than rosy picture of the economy. Core durable goods orders fell by 0.1% in January, month-on-month, adding further pressure on yields. Outside of the data, uncertainty over Brexit supported demand for U.S Treasuries in the early part of the week. It was a vastly different story later on in the week, once mortgage rates had been calculated. Parliament voted in favor of an extension to Article 50, further easing the near-term chance of a no-deal departure from the EU. The vote came after a Wednesday vote in favor of blocking the option to depart on a no-deal basis. Freddie Mac Rates The weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 14 th March were quoted by Freddie Mac to be : 30-year fixed rates fell by 10 basis points to 3.31% in the week. Rates were down from 4.44% from a year ago. The average fee fell from 0.5 points to 0.4 points. 15-year fixed rates slipped by 7 basis points to 3.76% in the week. Rates were down from 3.90% from a year ago. The average fee held steady at 0.4 points. 5-year fixed rates eased by 3 basis points to 3.84% in the week. Rates increased by 17 basis points from last years 3.67%. The average fee held steady at 0.3 points. Mortgage Bankers Association Rates For the week ending 8 th March, rates were quoted to be : Average interest rates for 30-year fixed, backed by the FHA, decreased from 4.66% to 4.61%. Points decreased from 0.48 to 0.47 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average interest rates for 30-year fixed with conforming loan balances decreased from 4.67% to 4.64%. Points increased from 0.44 to 0.47 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Average 30-year rates for jumbo loan balances increased from 4.41% to 4.45%. Points increased from 0.25 to 0.34 (incl. origination fee) for 80% LTV loans. Story continues Weekly figures released by the Mortgage Bankers Association showed that the Market Composite Index, which is a measure of mortgage loan application volume, rose by 2.3% in the week ending 8 th March. The increase partially reversed a 2.5% fall from the previous week. The Refinance Index slipped by 0.2% in the week ending 1 st March. The decline followed on from a 2% fall from the previous week. The share of refinance mortgages decreased from 40.0% to 38.6%, following a fall from 40.4% to 40.0% in the week prior. According to the MBA, marginally higher mortgage rates led to a fall in applications in the week. The MBA also noted that the average loan size for purchase applications increased to a record high. The MBA noted that purchase activity picked up last week by almost 2% from the previous year. The upward trend in purchase activity has continued for 4 consecutive weeks, supporting the positive outlook for the housing market. The MBA also released its monthly New Home Purchase Mortgage Application report for February. According to the February report, mortgage applications for new home purchases increased by 3%, year-on-year. Month-on-month, mortgage applications surged by 6% in February. For the week ahead Its a particularly quiet first half of the week on the economic calendar. January factory orders are due out on Tuesday. While skewed to the negative, the focus will remain on the U.S  China trade talks and Brexit early on in the week. Further progress on trade talks and any vote in favor of Theresa Mays Brexit deal would support a jump in U.S Treasury yields. Things will get a little more complicated on Wednesday, with the FEDs March policy decision. While interest rates are expected to be left unchanged, the FOMC projections will have a material impact. The focus will likely be on projections for growth and interest rate hikes for the coming year. Anything dovish and mortgage rates could be in for another slide. With the peak home-buying season rapidly approaching, economic indicators and the FED will need to be on the more favorable side to support the housing market. House price growth has slowed and mortgage rates are at more than 1-year lows. Prospective buyers will need to have a positive outlook on the economy and employment to take advantage of the current buying environment.

From Mining Bitcoin to Tracking Music IP on a Blockchain Tech companies trying to make waves in the music industry is nothing new. Bitfury is a significant player in the blockchain industry, however, which makes this foray particularly interesting. The aim of decentralizing the music industry has long been a pipedream but could now be closer to reality. The open-source platform, labeled SurroundTM, will purportedly simplify the safe transferal of copyright assets. At the very core of the project is the creation of an environment that allows musicians to manage their affairs far more efficiently. This includes monitoring their output, being able to see what works, and — most importantly — what doesn’t.

Changpeng Zhao, the CEO of Binance, believes that a lot of development has taken place in the crypto space, implying that cryptocurrencies are currently undervalued.So should the traders start buying? Let’s find out. \\xa0BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) has been trading below the moving averages since Jan. 10. Attempts by the bulls to push the price higher have been met with selling at the moving averages. This is a bearish sign.The cryptocurrency hasn’t been able to make a higher high and a higher low, a signal that we were watching out for. A set of higher highs and higher lows would indicate a probable change in trend.If the bears force the price below $3,236.09, it will be a new lower low that would confirm the continuation of the downtrend.The first sign of a probable change in trend will be when the BTC/USD pair breaks out of the downtrend line and sustains above it. The recovery will gain strength if the bulls scale above $4,255. Until then, every rise to the resistance levels will be sold into.We might suggest long positions closer to $3,236.09 if the price rebounds sharply from the support, because that would indicate a strong demand at lower levels. Another probable trade can be taken on a breakout above $4,255. Until then, we suggest traders remain in a wait and see mode.XRP/USDRipple (XRP) has been trading in a tight range since Jan. 11. This is unlikely to continue for long. We expect either a breakout or breakdown from this range within the next few days.The downtrending moving averages and the RSI in the negative area suggest that sellers are at an advantage. If the bears force a breakdown below the range, the XRP/USD pair can drop to $0.27795.On the other hand, if the bulls push the price above the moving averages and the downtrend line, the digital currency can move up to $0.4. We suggest traders wait for a bullish pattern to form before jumping in to buy.ETH/USDEthereum (ETH) plummeted below the immediate support of $116.3 on Jan. 20, but the bears could not sustain the lower levels. The bulls pulled back from the lows and closed (UTC time frame) above the support line.If the ETH/USD pair fails to find buyers at higher levels and reverses direction, it can fall to $107.51, and if that support also breaks, a drop to $83 will be possible. The downtrending 20-day EMA, as well as the RSI in the negative territory confirm that the sellers have the upper hand in the short term.The digital currency will show strength if it breaks out of $134.5. It can then rally to $167.32, which is likely to act as a stiff resistance.BCH/USDBitcoin Cash (BCH) has been trading in a tight range of $120–$137.26 for the past 10 days. This shows that both the buyers and the sellers have stopped actively trading it.If the bears push the price below $120, the BCH/USD pair can plunge further to $100, and below that a retest of the lows around $73.5 will be probable. The falling moving averages, and the RSI below 40 levels suggest that the sellers have the upper hand.Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency scales above both the moving averages and the $137.26 mark. We shall wait for a reliable buy setup to form before proposing a trade.EOS/USDEOS is currently range bound between $2.3093 and $3.2081. The bears are attempting to break down of the range, while the bulls are trying to defend it.On Jan. 13 and 14, the EOS/USD pair bounced off the support of the range, but the bulls could not carry it above the 20-day EMA. This is a bearish sign. Any break of the immediate support of the range, and the $2.1733 mark, can result in a fall to $1.7746, and further to $1.55.Our bearish view will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency bounces off the support of the range and sustains above $2.5840. If that happens, a rally to the resistance of the range at $3.2081 will be possible. We might suggest long positions above $2.6.XLM/USDThe bulls attempted to carry Stellar (XLM) higher on Jan. 19, but could not scale the 20-day EMA. Currently, the bears are attempting to break down of the immediate support at $0.10235190.If they are successful, a drop to the yearly low of $0.09285498 will be probable. If this level breaks down, the XLM/USD pair will resume its downtrend. Both moving averages are sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative zone, which suggests that the bears have the upper hand.The first sign of a likely change in trend will be when the bulls succeed in pushing the price above the downtrend line of the symmetrical triangle. A confirmation of strength will be when the pair sustains above $0.13427050. We shall wait for a trend reversal before recommending a long position.LTC/USDThe bears are not allowing Litecoin (LTC) to sustain above the 20-day EMA, while the bulls are not allowing the price to plummet below $29.349.If the LTC/USD pair plunges below $29.349, it could slide further to $27.701, below which a fall to the yearly lows of $23.090 will be likely. The downtrend will resume if the price breaks down to new yearly lows.Conversely, if the bulls push the price above the 20-day EMA, the virtual currency could rally to $36.428, and beyond that to $40.784. The flat moving averages and the RSI close to 50 levels suggests a balance between the buyers and the sellers.The next move will happen when this balance tilts in favor of either of the parties. For now, the traders who own long positions can keep a stop loss at $27.5.TRX/USDTron (TRX) has corrected to the 20-day EMA, which might act as a support. However, if the bears break below this support, a fall to $0.02113440, followed by a drop to the 50-day SMA will be probable.The TRX/USD pair has been range bound since Aug. 8, 2018. Attempts to break out or break down of this range have been unsuccessful and the price always returned into the range.There are two possible trade opportunities. The traders can either buy closer to $0.0183 and expect the price to reach $0.02815521, or they can buy on a close (UTC time frame) above $0.02815521.The uptrending moving averages suggest that the bulls have the upper hand. We shall turn negative on the cryptocurrency if the price slumps and sustains below $0.0183.BSV/USDBitcoin SV (BSV) is gradually giving up ground, which shows a lack of buying support at the current levels. If the price sustains below $74.022, a drop to the next support at $65.031 will be probable.The 20-day EMA is gradually sloping down, and the RSI is in the negative territory. This shows that the bears have an advantage in the short term. If the BSV/USD pair breaks below $65.031, it will result in liquidation of long trades. The supports on the downside are at $57, and below that at $38.528.Our bearish view will be negated if the digital currency scales above both moving averages. We shall wait for the trend to turn positive before recommending any trades.ADA/USDCardano (ADA) is currently trading inside an ascending channel. Usually, the price oscillates between the support and the resistance line of the channel. It reached the resistance line of the channel on Jan. 10, from where it turned down, and is now likely to fall down to the support line of the channel.Having broken below the 20-day EMA, the ADA/USD pair might find support at the 50-day SMA. If this support breaks, the buyers might step in at the support line of the channel.Our expectation of a drop to the support line of the channel will be invalidated if the cryptocurrency turns around from the current levels and breaks out of the 20-day EMA.We couldn’t find any reliable buy setups at the current levels. The flat moving averages, and the RSI close to the midpoint suggest a consolidation in the near term. Because of these factors, we remain neutral on the pair.The market data is provided by the HitBTC exchange.

Now you can create your own crypto-based sweepstakes with Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s event paper wallet generator. With Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Golden Ticket program and open source code, the software allows anyone to develop fantastic tickets funded with bitcoin cash (BCH). Also Read:&#xA0;Peer-to-Peer Trading Platform Bitquick Implements Bitcoin Cash Support Create Your Own Bitcoin Cash Giveaway With Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Golden Ticket Software At Bitcoin.com we love to spread cryptocurrency awareness. In order to further grow adoption in a fun way this month, we decided to publish the open source Bitcoin.com Golden Ticket repository which can be found on Github. The code allows anyone with a light knowledge of terminal command prompts to create amazing giveaway tickets loaded with BCH. The Golden Ticket platform allows the creator to choose a custom mnemonic language or Hierarchical Deterministic (HD) key creation. But it also generates HTML, pdf, and a spreadsheet mapping of the Cashddr format, Privkey, and index the swept status of each golden ticket. Alongside this, the giveaway ticket creators can redeem unswept BCH after a certain period of time. Spread adoption with Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Golden Ticket. Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Golden Ticket program requires the installation of Nodejs LTS version 8 and use of the computer&#x2019;s terminal application to run command lines. After Nodejs has been added, the user simply clones the Golden Ticket Github repo and installs the dependencies. There are seven actions within the workflow, comprising generating a wallet, creating addresses, initiating a CSV, funding the mothership address, funding secondary addresses, generating stats, and lastly reclaiming the funds that were unswept. How to Create Custom Golden Tickets Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s Golden Ticket app requires Nodejs and a little terminal prompt knowledge. The first thing to do is generate a 256-bit mnemonic and BIP44 BCH address by typing &#x201C;npm run generate-wallet&#x201D; into the terminal. After that, you will be prompted to choose a language out of the eight available. If you don&#x2019;t enter a language, the Golden Ticket program will default to English. Following this choice, you should choose an HD path. If nothing custom is chosen, it will default to the BIP44 account of your mnemonic: m/44&#x2019;/145&#x2019;/0&#x2032;. From here you can choose a custom name for the giveaway&#xA0;ticket event or choose to leave it as is and let the name default to &#x201C;Golden Ticket.&#x201D; After the name is chosen, it will write to the owner&#x2019;s mnemonic, HD Path, and the mothership address. The address, called the mothership, is the address an individual or organization funds in order to fund all the other generated addresses. After running the command line &#x201C;npm run create-addresses&#x201D; the program will prompt the creator for an event name, HD Account and an address count. You can verify the addresses created by typing &#x201C;npm run create-csv&#x201D; and follow this step by funding the mothership address. Our Golden Ticket program shows the mothership&#x2019;s written alphanumeric address alongside a QR code that&#x2019;s easy to fund. After the wallet is loaded, simply type &#x201C;npm run fund-addresses&#x201D; to begin adding bitcoin cash to the satellite addresses tethered to the mothership. From here, the lotto tickets can be printed on paper or card material in order to hand out at an event. After the event finishes, you can simply run the Golden Ticket software and enter &#x201C;npm run generate-stats&#x201D; into the terminal to generate basic stats about the event&#x2019;s tickets. If a lot of people in the crowd decided not to sweep the bitcoin cash into a mobile wallet or desktop client at home, the mothership can have funds sent back after a certain period of time. If the creator wishes, the custom giveaway tickets can have a disclaimer on them explaining there is a time frame for redemption. We gave away Golden Tickets loaded with BCH at the Libertycon 2019 event in Washington D.C. Giveaways generate a lot of excitement and we think funded tickets with the best peer-to-peer cash system in the world go hand in hand with cool events. Bitcoin.com recently gave out a ton of Golden Tickets to participants at Liberty Con 2019 in Washington D.C. and the initiative was a great success.

He has now been jailed for four and a half years along with his team of thieves. Also read: Iceland’s ‘Big Bitcoin Heist’: Suspects Charged With Over $2M in Stolen Mining Rigs &#8216;Big Bitcoin Heist&#8217; Sindri Por Stefansson hit headlines last year after managing to escape from his jail cell following his arrest for stealing millions of dollars of mining equipment. Local media have since reported that he was sentenced to four-and-a-half years&#8217; imprisonment last week. His six other partners in crime were jailed for a total of nine years and seven months. Advania, the mining company that the gear was stolen from, received over $200,000 in compensation. The crime, dubbed the &#8216;Big Bitcoin Heist&#8217; by the media, saw the men steal over 600 mining computers from Advania. The equipment has yet to be recovered. Stefansson managed to escape from Sogn prison and board a flight to Stockholm at the international airport in Keflavik. According to police, he was using someone else&#8217;s passport. In an even stranger twist, Stefansson found himself on the same plane as the country&#8217;s prime minister while on the run. He was later arrested in Amsterdam. In an interview with the New York Times, Stefansson said he was looking at international flights on his phone – which weren&#8217;t prohibited in his prison – before he booked one and climbed out of his low-security jail cell window. After hitchhiking to Keflavik, he grabbed a plane from the country&#8217;s largest airport to Stockholm and from there got to Amsterdam via train, bus and taxi. Not the First Heist Stefansson&#8217;s case made headlines around the world because low-crime Iceland, with its population of little over 338,000, is a difficult place to be a fugitive – let alone flee from. In the heist, Stefansson and his crew were reportedly able to steal 225 fully functional Bitmain mining rigs with the help of an insider, and wore security uniforms as part of their deception. It wasn&#8217;t their first attempt to steal from bitcoin miners, either. In December 2017 the group had stolen 100 mining rigs from Algrim Consulting and later tried to steal from the Borealis Data Center (BDC), but were unable to get away with their haul after they set off an alarm. Police revealed the group also tried to steal from BDC Mines a couple of days later but again failed, though were successful at the Borgarnes mining facility. There was a further attempt at BDC Mines but alarms again foiled their plans. Iceland has become a hotspot for bitcoin and cryptocurrency mining due its large amount of renewable energy and cold weather which helps keeps computers cool.

I could write a whole separate post just on this, but the APL Telegram group is the single most brainwashed group of people I have ever seen in crypto, and that\\'s saying something because I\\'ve been in 100\\'s of Telegrams. **Saying ANYTHING - and I\\'m not kidding - ANYTHING - about the tech of APL (even asking a question about it), mentioning NXT, saying the word \"fork\", \"dump\", \"sell\" - the list goes on - will get you immediately banned**. They ban so often that I\\'ve made a list of comments that got people banned so far:\\n\\n\\\\-\"The price is up 700% in a week. I think I might take some profit in case it drops\"\\n\\n\\\\-\"Isn\\'t the privacy of this coin exactly the same as NXT? Can someone explain how it is any better?\"\\n\\n\\\\-\"Why do you keep banning people for asking legitimate questions?\" (followed up with response from an admin \"These \\'questions\\' are just FUD on NXT\\'s tech...these people just want to see the project fail\".\\n\\n\\\\- \"How do you plan to implement sharding in Q1 when their is no code in the Github for it yet?\"\\n\\n\\\\- \"You guys think the privacy of this coin is really better than Monero?\"\\n\\nNot only will you get banned. If you ask a question about the tech and get banned, the rest of the Telegram follows it up in the chat BY HAILING THE ADMINS like they are some sort of savant for saving them from the terribles FUDers. It is actually so ridiculous that I invite you, /r/cryptocurrency, to go see this for yourself. Ask a question - any question - about the tech of NXT - or really, just say anything that isn\\'t \"NXT TO THE MOON!\". Just google the Telegram for the Apollo Community and see what goes on there for yourself.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n# The Founder: Steve McCullah\\n\\nNow let\\'s talk about the founder. I\\'m not even concerned if he was a scammer or not in the past, that\\'s irrelevant. The concern is what he\\'s doing right now. Besides clearly dumping coins, he is using the Telegram - which through banning all opposition to the project is essentially just a massive brainwashed hivemind that will do whatever the founder says - to pump the coin and swarm anyone who tries to pose any sort of legitimate argument against it with tons of people who act like they would die for this project. This has happenned at least 15+ times since yesterday in the Telegram. Here\\'s a great example: [https://imgur.com/a/09vUQo9](https://imgur.com/a/09vUQo9)\\n\\n**That is the FOUNDER of the project**. His defense to criticism always has to do with the price/market cap of the project, usually followed with a vague promise about how some tech planned on the APL roadmap will pump APL more and destroy other cryptocurrencies. To see how well it works, read the comments of that tweet: [https://twitter.com/lioryaffe/status/1087075217447546882](https://twitter.com/lioryaffe/status/1087075217447546882)\\n\\nSo this is bad, but then there\\'s the fake news. The Founder CONSTANTLY publishes fake news to his massive army of shills to keep them buying and pumping the price of APL so he can dump on them. Here\\'s an excellent example of this: [https://imgur.com/a/eUCENY7](https://imgur.com/a/eUCENY7)\\n\\nThis one happened a few hours ago, and the APL Telegram is taking this news at face value, no questions asked, and talking about how Bitcoin is dead - that APL is new standard. They are eating news like this up as 100% fact. If you ask any questions about that news - what are the actual location, where are the news articles, etc - community turns on you and will call you names until an admin bans you. If an admin is there, you\\'ll just get banned immediately. Seen it happen at least 10 times already with this one piece of news.\\n\\nThe founder, when trying to defend this project, shills a few major points:\\n\\n1. \"3rd generation cryptocurrency\" (as if forking NXT in 2018 magically makes this project better than all others),\\n2. Ultimate privacy (Guess what? It\\'s not private at all! They use a coin scrammbler in the wallet- something which exists for bitcoin, ethereum, and many other coins - and claim that this makes their coin have the greatest privacy of any coin ever,\\n3. Decentralized file-storage (we all know storing files on the actual blockchain itself is essentially impossible, especially with NXT\\'s tech - not that they even have any product out for this claim anyway. Don\\'t worry, it\\'s \"coming soon\" though)\\n4. Their coin \"Forging\" system - something already implemented by NXT that they have given a new name to\\n\\nI don\\'t even know what can be done at this point, or how to stop this machine from turning and making the founders rich. They already made several millions from dumping last time so they had the funds to hire John McAfee ...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nThe gold prices pulled back slightly during the Monday’s session reaching down to test the 50 Day EMA but then turned around showing signs of strength.

The beverage titan owns four of the world's top five soft drink brands and is responsible for more than half of all sales in that massive industry. Meanwhile, its distribution system delivers 1.9 billion drinks to consumers in 200 countries around the world per day . It would take billions of dollars, and likely decades, for any rival to even hope to challenge that infrastructure. Yet that dominant business hasn't created strong returns for investors lately, with shares trailing the broader market over the last three-year and five-year periods. Below, we'll look at the prospects for a better run for shareholders over the coming decade. Brown soda and ice in a glass with a straw. Image source: Getty Images. Times are changing Consumer tastes are shifting in ways that have clearly harmed Coke's business . People are passing on drinks they see as overly sweet or packed with artificial ingredients, and that move has created a difficult selling environment for the industry leader. The Diet Coke brand booked a 5% volume decline in the U.S. last year, for example, as Coke's overall volume held flat. Compare that to National Beverage 's 17% spike, powered by booming demand for sparkling soda brands like LaCroix. Coke's earnings picture hasn't been bright, either. After adjusting for currency shifts, non- GAAP profit fell in 2015 and dropped again in 2016, before merely holding steady last year. At-home sparkling water specialist SodaStream , on the other hand, just managed its second straight year of record profitability. Plan of attack Coke isn't consigned to simply manage its slow decline. The company introduced more than 500 products last year that represented either entirely new brands or improvements to existing franchises. Its Coke Zero Sugar release was a highlight from that strategy and the new drink helped replace some of the losses from Diet Coke's stumbles. Bolt-on acquisitions are helping the company further tilt its portfolio toward the flavors that consumers are demanding in high-growth niches like tea, energy drinks, juice, and sparkling waters. Story continues A woman drinking sparkling water from a glass. Image source: Getty Images. At the same time, Coke is pursuing a financial strategy that could supercharge earnings in the years ahead. With its refranchising and cost-cutting moves, management has increased profit margins while lowering the amount of capital needed to run the business. Return on that capital, consequently, jumped by 1.6 percentage points to touch 19% of sales last year. CEO James Quincey and his team believe that's just the start though, and they're predicting higher margins in 2018 , which they believe will be an inflection year for the business following several years of weakening financial results. Can Coca-Cola turn things around? Coke is expecting to speed sales growth up to 4% this year from 3% in 2017 even as profit margins improve. These two positive trends should support non-GAAP earnings growth of between 8% and 10% to mark the company's first gain by that metric in over three years. As usual, investors can expect those returns to be supplemented by a growing dividend and significant share buybacks. Specifically, Coke should spend about $1 billion repurchasing its stock and its 5% dividend hike, announced in February, marked its 56th consecutive annual raise. Put it all together and it wouldn't be surprising to see consistent returns in the low-double-digit range over the next few years. Investors could achieve higher rates with smaller soda specialists like National Beverage. But a Coca-Cola investment would deliver better predictability, conservative growth, and income. Shares won't soar as they have for both National Beverage and SodaStream over the past few years. But at 20 times expected earnings, compared to 27 for SodaStream and 21 for National Beverage, the beverage titan's stock should deliver decent investor returns from here.

While most have lost value this year, energy MLPs have been among the hardest-hit, buckling under the added weight of a rule change and rising interest rates. Among those taking it on the chin is Phillips 66 Partners (NYSE: PSXP) , which has declined more than 15% from its peak earlier this year. That drop, when combined with another 5% increase in its distribution, has pushed its yield up to 5.7%, the highest in the company's history. That looks like an attractive entry point for income-seeking investors, given the growth the company has lined up. A man holding a lightbulb next to a growing stack of coins Image source: Getty Images. Stomping on the gas Phillips 66 Partners is coming off a big year. Earnings catapulted 60% to $754 million, while distributable cash flow leaped more than 50% to $572 million thanks to a string of acquisitions completed in the past year.

And yet, in this case, it produces an egregiously distasteful outcome in that the shareholders of MtGox would walk away with the value of over 160,000 bitcoin as a result of what happened.\\nI don't want this.

The volumes were so large that suspicions remain the sales unfairly influenced Bitcoin prices across the globe.\\nWednesday’s AMA similarly saw its share of Karpeles detractors, some levelling criticism due to their questions remaining answered for long periods.\\n\"]]\n- Bitcoin News: [[139345, '2018-04-04 23:10:27', 'Bitcoin vs Oil and Gold: There Is a Difference', 'bitcoin-vs-oil-and-gold-there-is-a-difference', 'Matt Hussey', 'It’s an easy comparison to make: Bitcoin mining versus gold and oil extraction. All &#8211; in the abstract sense for bitcoin &#8211; involve unearthing resources, all have had bumpy price histories, and all have been labeled as disruptive in their time. Also read: Crypto Exchanges Charging Up To $3 Million To List Tokens Gold vs Oil vs Bitcoin There are crucial differences between the three assets, especially when it comes to tracking what happens to supply after an increase in price. Twitter user @WallSt_Dropout produced a series of fascinating charts that help illustrate those differences perfectly. First, oil. As the price of oil starts to climb, there’s a marked response in oil production. Why? Because now there’s extra incentive to invest in infrastructure/extraction capabilities. As oil production begins to outstrip demand, there’s a drop in the price of oil. It’s now not as profitable to remove quite as much oil as before, so production eases off. As oil prices start to recover &#8211; thanks to restrictions in supply from the last cycle &#8211; the drillers turn their machines back on and produce more of the black stuff. The same applies to gold. Beginning in 2008, monthly gold ore production is low, thanks to consistently low prices in the previous decade. As market forces begin to push the price of gold up &#8211; remember that financial crash? &#8211; production ramps up to keep track of prices. As gold prices take a dip in 2012, ore production levels off. In bitcoin’s case, the opposite is true. In 2010, when the block reward for production was higher, prices were low. As prices have climbed, the rewards for mining have dropped off. There isn’t the same cyclical relationship between supply and demand found in oil and gold. Bitcoin Is different This is a key function of how bitcoin works. The bitcoin block mining reward halves every 210,000 blocks. At present the coin reward is 12.5 coins. According to Bitcoinblockhalf.com, by May 2020, the reward will drop to 6.25 coins. How will miners make money after the block rewards end in 2140? Transaction fees. Gold miners don’t control the buying and selling of the product, whereas bitcoin miners charge transaction fees for the confirmation work they complete. It would be the equivalent of an oil platform charging individuals a small fee for the oil they use in their cars. It’s a necessary part of the system. Think of it as miners creating a fixed amount of land every 10 minutes. People who want to make a transaction bid for a slice of that land. The sale of that tiny portion of land is what keeps miners mining. As the Bitcoin inflation rate steadily trends downwards, the necessity of transaction fees to incentivize miners to keep mining will go up – in the far future. Oil and gold are commodities that have no ‘real’ end date, i.e. there are still resources lying beneath the ground. Despite fears of peak oil and peak gold, companies keep finding more of the stuff as technology allows them to pinpoint their location and extract it with greater accuracy. We already know how much bitcoin is left to be mined. Which makes bitcoin mining a very different proposition than mining other real world commodities.

Further, Shishido has been promoting a new BCH branding idea within the community by calling smaller fractions of BCH &#x2018;Cash&#x2019; instead of &#x2018;Bits&#x2019; and so far some members of the BCH community have been embracing the concept. Also Read: OTC Cryptocurrency Desks Trade Billions Over Skype Promoting Bitcoin Cash Throughout Japan and Worldwide Ken Shishido is well known in Japan throughout the cryptocurrency circuit. He is the organizer and co-founder of the Tokyo Bitcoin Cash Meetup. Just recently Shishido gave a presentation on how he thinks adoption should be promoted in Japan and some of the ways he and the Meetup members have been bolstering widespread acceptance. At the Satoshi&#x2019;s Vision Conference (SVC) Shishido explains that he has hosted over 170 cryptocurrency Meetups over the past years, describing his background within the bitcoin industry in Japan. The Tokyo Meetup organizer has also traveled all around the world spreading the gospel of cryptocurrencies as well. Shishido explains to the crowd that Japan has one of the highest populations of cryptocurrency users worldwide with roughly 2 million users in the country, according to his estimates.

BUIP087: Using the Denomination &#x2018;Cash&#x2019; for One Hundred Satoshi During the end of Shishido&#x2019;s discussion he briefly mentions one the goals he is currently working on which is changing the name for smaller fractions of bitcoin cash from &#x2018;Bits&#x2019; to &#x2018;Cash.&#x2019; Essentially, Shishido has submitted a BUIP request to change the terminology in bitcoin cash to &#x201C;cash&#x201D; (CSH) as the standard term for 100 (one hundred) &#x2018;satoshi&#x2019; or 1/1,000,000 (one one-millionth) of a bitcoin cash (BCH). Shishido explains his motivation for wanting to change the current terminology. &#x201C;Bitcoin cash strives for the worldwide adoption, and unit denomination and calculation must be easy for the average users for daily transactions &#x2014; And, it needs to to be differentiated from Bitcoin Core (BTC) to avoid confusion,&#x201D; explains Shishido&#x2019;s BUIP request. The &#x201C;cash&#x201D; denomination has been discussed and proposed by many people before. Authors of this BUIP take no credit for inventing the term &#x2014; As BCH grows in price versus fiat currencies, it&#x2019;s important to give users the ability to quickly and accurately calculate prices for transactions, savings and other economic activities. Bitmain CEO Jihan Wu likes the look of the &#x2018;cash&#x2019; denomination. Unit Wallet Adds the &#x2018;Cash&#x2019; Denomination So far Shishido&#x2019;s idea has been welcomed by the community and he has been asking businesses to consider the idea. Just recently the bitcoin cash-centric mobile platform Unit Wallet just launched its latest 2.0 version with new features like the Cash address format. Unit Wallet&#x2019;s new user interface features the &#x2018;cash&#x2019; denomination. Moreover, Unit Wallet also utilized Shishido&#x2019;s cash denomination concept and smaller fractions of BCH contain the word &#x2018;cash&#x2019; in the user interface.&#xA0;Check out why Ken Shishido thinks BCH proponents should bolster the idea of a &#x2018;cash&#x2019; denomination in the video below.

There are now so many of these &#8216;bitcoin mules&#8217; that their profit margins are rapidly declining. Also Read: Okex Fights Market Manipulation Rumors Following Painful Futures Contracts Rollback Bitcoin Smuggling Chinese bitcoin mules are buying bitcoin in various markets around the world and smuggling it back in to the country to fuel the flourishing and unregulated OTC (over-the-counter) market, according to a report from the region. However, the business isn&#8217;t as lucrative as it was a few months ago. John DeCleene, an assistant fund manager at Overseas Chinese Investment Management, explained: “The market’s kind of taken a downturn; It is too many players entering this market, but also less of the hype we saw in December-January, when people were paying a 30 percent premium because they expected 10 times gains overnight.” Hedge Funds Are Getting in on the Arbitrage Action In lieu of local exchanges, Chinese investors are turning to over the counter trading, while using social media messengers, bank wires and online payment networks. “The big Chinese traders are all using Coincola or going direct to each other through other OTC platforms,” said Christian Grewell, a professor at NYU in Shanghai. Reuters has interviewed a mule that admitted to illegally entering the United States with up to $40,000 to buy bitcoin which she then sells on the Chinese OTC markets. “Selling and buying bitcoins on those OTC websites is the same as shopping on Taobao,” she commented. Besides an influx of mules, hedge funds are also taking a cut of the market driving down potential profits. “In the beginning, when there is 30 percent arbitrage, obviously you can travel to Thailand, buy bitcoins, send them to China, Japan, Korea and sell them. That’s easy,” said Peter Kim of KI...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): #VipScandals_com #Trump #World #Hollywood #Fashion #Celebrities #Bitcoin #News #Gossip #Showbiz #Paparazzi • http://vipscandals.com  • http://www.vipscandals.com/archives/464841  || Install CryptoTab and mine Bitcoin! https://getcryptotab.com/16347  XX Good Morning XX Lets get Mining lolz XX || Making our user chat private and secure with AES-512 encryption.

Today I\\'m going to give you an update on bitcoin and where the price is heading next. I will be writing in a longer term perspective.\\n\\nThere are really great stuff coming for bitcoin that makes it fundamentally strong investment at these low levels. Following news and keeping eyes on these projects that are coming to bitcoin might give you an idea. I\\'m trying to keep this unbiased and also it is worth to keep in mind that this is not an financial advice. Do your own research and if you decide to invest or trade these decisions are totally up to you.\\n\\nOverall sentiment and atmosphere is very bearish. Main reason for this is that a lot of people bought at the high prices, expecting high returns but each time it showed signs of a bullish reversal, downtrend resistance was hit and it dropped even lower. This is likely a good buying opportunity because when overall sentiment is pessimistic, markets are likely to recover soon after. This is known as \"the herd effect\" when majority of people follows a bit behind and have made some losses.\\n\\nAnyways let\\'s get to the technical part.\\n\\nIn the both charts (Linear &amp; Log) - both downtrend lines got violated and it got pierced through. Linear managed to recover back above of the uptrend line and which also rejected strong support level found at $6.800.\\n\\n\\n[Image 1 LOG-chart]\\n\\n\\n[Image 2 LINEAR-chart]\\n\\nThe linear chart (Longer term)\\nis showing us signs of recovery on the daily timeframe.\\n\\nStochRSI has taken oversold position, pointing upwards and has a plenty of space to move upwards.\\nRSI agrees with StochRSI when it took oversold position, bounced and now is pointing upwards\\nHammer pattern which can be found at $6.800 level.\\nThe price is heading towards the first resistance zone which has acted previously as a support area. This area should not be neglected as the price might have a minor pullback from this level. More details on this down below.\\n\\n\\n[Image 3 The Daily Chart]\\n\\nConfirmations are very important when it comes to trends. The daily candle needs to close above of $8000 resistance level to give a bullish confirmation and that the price is wanting to move further upwards or needs to break above of it with force to indicate that buyers are back in the game.\\n\\nTo see full bull mode on, the price needs to breach above of the second resistance level which can be found in between of $9.000 level and $9.500 level. This is why it\\'s crucial to follow the price movement near to the first resistance zone and see which direction it will take from there. It\\'s worth noticing that after huge downtrend, recovery should not be expected to happen quickly. Recovery from a bear trend takes time and will gradually turn in to a bull trend.\\n\\n\\n[Image 4 The 4h Chart]\\n\\nThe 4h chart (medium term)\\nis showing signs of exhaustion and minor pullback should be expected soon.\\n\\nStochRSI + RSI takes overbought position\\nHovering close to resistance zone ( formed by $7.500 level and $8.000 level) where it\\'s likely to have minor pullback before moving back up again.\\nNo bearish divergence other than on the 1h chart (not reliable / confirmed yet)\\nConclusion:\\nThe daily and fundamental aspects of bitcoin are showing that with these prices it\\'s likely a good opportunity to open longer term trades. If it does manage to break above of the first resistance zone, then there are two ways to enter this breakout:\\n\\nThe breakout\\nThe retest of the breakout\\nFor the short term traders minor pullback should be expected and for the longer term, it\\'s starting look good.\\n\\nDISCLAIMER:\\nPlease be aware this is not financial advice. You are responsible for your trading and investing decisions.

I love to see professional magicians perform, there is nothing better than when you see a trick and you have no idea how it was done.\\n\\nI read a forum post a month ago that had a link to a YouTube video, *10 times magic went wrong*.  I checked it out, and as you can imagine, the contents were quite horrific.  Two of the clips were of the *Nail Under the Cups* trick.  If you are from England, you may have seen Derren Brown performing this.  It\\'s a good one, if the magician is qualified.  If they aren\\'t, then you end up being at positions seven and three of this video.\\n\\nA magician mixes up some cups, under one is a piece of wood with a nail pointed up.  The others are weighted, so they all feel the same. The magician puts on a blindfold and gets their volunteer to guide them over the top of the cups.  The magician then pushes the volunteer\\'s hand down, crushing the cup.  It\\'s usually when there are two left that this trick goes wrong.  And when it does it\\'s very bloody.\\n\\nThe clip in question though, is of a man sawing a woman in half.  We\\'ve all seen this.  But in this grainy footage, the woman screams, the box is brought apart, blood drips from the opening and the legs of the woman slip out.  The bloody bottom half slams on the floor with a thunk, the legs spasm, then stop.  The curtains are hastily brought across and the show ends.\\n\\nThere are comments after the video, people calling bullshit, until someone posted the full trick in question.  At the end of this video, the woman can be seen on stage, whole again, nothing wrong with her at all.\\n\\nPeople argue with each other that the woman must have been in the upper box and the lower box contained some prosthetics.  The thread ends with someone saying that they swear it\\'s real, they\\'ve seen it in person.\\n\\nI commented saying, \"I\\'m skeptical, magic is illusion, no one gets sawn in half; incredible footage though.\"\\n\\nThe next day, I get a direct message from someone with the handle Tricked4Life.\\n\\n*Hey Baz1987, the man from that video is performing next month.  He\\'s called The Russian, it\\'s invite only.  I can arrange tickets if you like?*\\n\\nI replied, *Totally, I\\'d be up for that, please!*\\n\\nWhile waiting to hear back, I went to watch the video again.  The link didn\\'t work, a message came up saying it had been taken down due to copyright infringement.  I tried the top 10 one too, that was also gone, just a 404 page.\\n\\nIt was a Saturday, so I was already on the whiskey and watching Netflix.  I think I was binge watching Breaking Bad for the third or forth time.\\n\\nTricked4Life replied with a link.  I browsed to the site.  It looked like something from 1997.  There was a still from the video and a form below.  Slightly drunk, I filled out the details and continued to the payment form.  I had to pay in BitCoin, what the fuck was that?\\n\\nI messaged Tricked4Life, *\"I don\\'t know what BitCoin is.\"*\\n\\n*\"PayPal me the money and I can buy it for you.\"*\\n\\n*\"How do I know this isn\\'t a scam?\"*\\n\\n*\"You don\\'t, but as a magician, you should see through a trick a mile off ;)\"*\\n\\nIt sounded like he was baiting me.\\n\\n*\"How much?\"*\\n\\n*\"£540.\"*\\n\\n*\"Christ, that\\'s heavy.\"*\\n\\n*\"It\\'s worth it though.\"*\\n\\n*\"Have you seen him before?\"*\\n\\n*\"No, this will be my first time.  I know some people who are going.  They said he\\'s incredible.  You have to see it for yourself.\"*\\n\\nI left the computer and continued watching TV, though I couldn\\'t concentrate.  I really wanted to know how the trick was done.  I drank more whiskey and got more drunk.\\n\\n***\\n\\nI woke in the early hours.  Confused, I took in my surroundings and realised I fell asleep in front of the television again.  My head pounded, so I went to the kitchen and drank some orange juice, before throwing the best hangover cure, bacon, into the frying pan.\\n\\nAs the meat sizzled, I checked my phone.  I had an email with the subject, *Ticket Confirmation*.  My heart sank.  I opened it up to see a confirmation number and an address... in the Ukraine.\\n\\nI\\'d bought things while I was drunk before, but not a ticket to a magic show in Eastern Europe.  Not only was I out £540, I\\'d need to book plane tickets and a hotel.\\n\\nI gazed at the whiskey bottle, to see it almost empty, not even as much as a shot left.  I felt embarrassed.\\n\\nI logged into...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nOn Wednesday morning, the price of one Bitcoin slipped back below the $9,000 mark for the first time this week, following several pieces of potentially worrying news for the cryptocurrency community. First came a blog post from Christine Lagarde, in which the head of the International Monetary Fund (IMF) urged regulators around the world to crack down on cryptocurrencies potential to be a major new vehicle for money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Lagarde raised the example of the AlphaBay darkweb marketplace , which was used to launder more than $1 billion before it was taken down. She also noted that the extreme volatility of crypto-assets could easily create new vulnerabilities in the financial system. Then came Googles early-Wednesday announcement that it will be banning ads for cryptocurrencies and initial coin offerings, or ICOs. made a similar move earlier this year, so the two biggest digital ad players are shunning the cryptocurrency space. At least, in theory. Facebooks attempts have been less than successful, with some people using off-brand spellings such as bitc0in to evade the social networks filters. Even without such tactics, it still seems a few scammy ICO-related pitches are making it onto Facebook . At the time of writing, around 7 a.m. Eastern Time, Bitcoin was down 3.66% at a value of $8,830, according to CoinMarketCap.com . While the recent news may not be so great for some in cryptocurrency circles, it wasnt all bad. On the plus side, Lagarde suggested that the blockchain technology that underpins cryptocurrencies such as bitcoin could also be used for regulatory purposes. The technology that enables instant global transactions could be used to create registries of standard, verified, customer information along with digital signatures. Better use of data by governments can also help free up resources for priority needs and reduce tax evasion, including evasion related to cross-border transactions, she wrote.

Relatively range bound through much of the day, Bitcoin recovered from an early morning low $3,810.2 to an early afternoon high $3,894.9 before hitting reverse to strike a late afternoon intraday low $3,788.1. Steering clear of the days first major support level at $3,738.70, Bitcoin rallied to a late in the day intraday high $3,987.00, breaking through the first major support level at $3,954.60, while falling short of $4,000 levels and the first major resistance level at $4,078.70. For the Bitcoin bulls, $4,000 continues to be the line in the sand, with Bitcoin now having failed to close out at $4,000 levels for a 4 th consecutive day and for a 7 th day in the last 8. There was no material news across the crypto wires at the start of the year to support the late in the day rally, with price forecasts for the year ahead taking most of the headlines, the main issue for Bitcoin and the broader market being the extended bearish trend that remains intact going into the New Year. Across the majors, Binance Coin was the only top 20 coin to see red at the start of the year, while Bitcoin Cash ABC led the way, rallying by 9.7% on Tuesday, Bitcoin Cash SV a distant second with an 8.26% Gain. With Bitcoins dominance down at 51.6% and the total crypto market cap rising back to $129.95bn, it was the start of the year that Bitcoin and the broader market needed, though with Bitcoin still languishing at sub-$4,000 levels, the bulls will have their work cut out to maintain the upward momentum through the week, even with the news wires being relatively crypto friendly. Get Into Cryptocurrency Trading Today At the time of writing, Bitcoin was down 0.2% to $3,955.3, with a start of a day morning high $3,980.2 coming up short of the first major resistance level at  $4,037.37 and more importantly $4,000 levels, to ease back to a morning low $3,938.6 before steadying, Bitcoin steering clear of the first major support level at $3,838.48 early on.

Most other cryptocurrencies are faring just as poorly or worse, and in total, more than $700 billion in market cap has been wiped off the cryptocurrency market since the late-2017 peak.\nSome experts argue that this is merely a technical correction, caused by a flurry of stop-loss orders. Others say that regulatory concerns and a continued lack of institutional money are also to blame. And many people simply believe this is the beginning of the long-awaited crypto-crash that many high-profile investors and executives have predicted.\nImage Source: Getty Images.\nAs I mentioned, most cryptocurrencies finished the weekend in the red. Excluding dollar-tied coins like Tether, here's how the largest cryptocurrencies are doing today:\n[{\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Bitcoin (BTC-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$3,863.70\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(26.2%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Ripple (XRP-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$0.36\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(26.6%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Ethereum (ETH-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$111.17\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(28.9%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Bitcoin Cash (BCH-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$301.40\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(47.2%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"EOS (EOS-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$3.27\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(21.4%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Stellar Lumens (XLM-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$0.15\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(36.4%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Litecoin (LTC-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$29.74\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(21.6%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Cardano (ADA-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$0.036\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(33.1%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"Monero (XMR-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$55.01\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(29.3%)\"}, {\"Cryptocurrency Name (Code)\": \"TRON (TRX-USD)\", \"Price in U.S. Dollars\": \"$0.012\", \"7-Day Change\": \"(28.2%)\"}]\nData Source: www.investing.com. Prices and daily changes as of November 26, 2018, at approximately 10:15 a.m. EST.Prices are rounded to the nearest cent where appropriate.\nWhile most cryptocurrency experts agree that there have been a few negative catalysts recently (we'll get to those in the next section), many say that the big swings we've been seeing can be attributed to automated selling based on stop-loss orders.\nIf you aren't familiar, here's the basic idea of how astop-loss ordercould work. Let's say that when bitcoin was trading for about $6,500, I thought it would rise to about $8,000 in a short time. However, to limit my downside risk, I set an order to automatically sell my coins if the price falls below $6,000.\nWhen orders like this are triggered, they can result in massive amounts of coins (or stocks) hitting the market at one time, as traders tend to set stop-loss prices at nice round numbers like $6,000, $5,000, or, most recently, $4,000.\nAs I said, cryptocurrency experts generally attribute the recent declines to a combination of negative (but temporary) catalysts and stop-loss selling. With that in mind, here's a rundown of the major negative factors that could have been weighing on cryptocurrency prices recently:\n• Worries about the now-completed \"hard fork\" (similar to a stock split or spin-off) in bitcoin cash were blamed for the initial declines from the relatively stable prices throughout October and early November.\n• Bitcoin's \"hash rate\" -- that is, the combined computing power thatbitcoin minersare using to create new coins -- has been falling. Bitcoin's hash rate is a good indicator of how much money, time, and resources people are willing to use in order to create new coins, so a lower hash rate can indicate falling interest.\n• Regulatory scrutiny has increased recently. The U.S. Justice Department is currently investigating whether last year's parabolic rise was due to manipulation, and the SEC recently issued its first civil penalties against cryptocurrency founders.\nFinally, many people believe that this is just the beginning of a long-awaited cryptocurrency collapse. Many high-profile investors and financial industry heavyweights, such as billionaire investorWarren BuffettandJPMorgan ChaseCEO Jamie Dimon, have publicly spoken out against bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and have expressed their beliefs that many or all cryptocurrencies will end up being essentially worthless. And this recent wave of declines has prompted some to renew their bearish calls.\nWhich side is right? Is bitcoin's drop a technical correction that was triggered by negative but temporary issues, or is there still a long way to go before the dust settles?\nMore From The Motley Fool\n• 16 Cryptocurrency Facts You Should Know\n• Experts Warned – The Crypto ‘Bloodbath’ Is Here\n• How to Buy Bitcoin\nMatthew Frankel, CFPhas no position in any of the stocks or cryptocurrencies mentioned.

BSV appeared following a hard fork in the Bitcoin Cash ( BCH ) blockchain in November of last year. The for resulted in two new coins; Bitcoin SV and Bitcoin ABC. The camp for Bitcoin SV (Satoshi’s Vision) was lead by Australian computer scientist Craig Wright , who has previously declared himself to be Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto . After the hard fork, Coinbase users holding BCH received an equal amount of BSV, however the exchange has, until now, not provided an option for users to withdraw their BSV. From now on, Coinbase clients are able to send their BSV balance to an external wallet.

Following the hard fork, United States-based cryptocurrency exchange Kraken began supporting both forks of BCH, while warning that “custodial losses taken on due to attacks originating from nChain or its affiliates will be socialized among all BSV holders on Kraken. Given the volatile state of the network and threats that have been made, Kraken cannot guarantee perfect custody of BSV.” In January, cryptocurrency statistics and wallet provider Blockchain.com announced it had launched partial support for BSV, letting its users have some of the same options with BSV as with its four other hosted cryptocurrencies — Bitcoin ( BTC ), BCH, Ethereum ( ETH ) and Stellar ( XLM ). According to data from CoinMarketCap , BSV has seen slight losses on the day, decreasing by 2.91 percent and trading around $62.70 at press time. On its weekly chart, the altcoin saw its lowest price point at $61.50 on Feb. 8, and a high of $67.04 on Feb. 8 as well.

In other words, a JPM Coin should always be valued at precisely $1, and should not increase or decrease in value as is the case for other coins in the crypto space. Don't Miss : Don’t spend hundreds on an Apple Watch when this $67 smartwatch has sleep tracking and 30-day battery life Ever since Bitcoin was introduced, the idea was that the blockchain technology that powers cryptocurrency can be used to process payments instantly, eliminating third parties from the process (financial institutions included), along with the costs involved in payment processing. But banks have been paying attention to the blockchain space over the past few years, and are ready to introduce their own blockchain-based payments solutions. The JPM Coins will be issued to JPMorgan clients when they deposit money to a particular JPMorgan account. The coins can then be used to transfer money to someone else’s account over the blockchain. The recipient of JPM Coins would then exchange them for fiat currency. The technology would reduce the typical settlement time for transactions, the bank says in its handy FAQ section, without mentioning any details about how much these instant blockchain-based transactions will cost customers. However, the company said that the JPM Coins are in testing for the time being, and only institutional clients will have access to the pilot program, mentioning that savings may be passed on to their customers: JPM Coin is currently designed for business-to-business money movement flows, and because we are still in a testing phase, we don’t have plans to make this available to individuals at this stage. That said, the cost-savings and efficiency benefits would extend to the end customers of our institutional clients. Story continues In other words, you won’t be able to use JPM Coin to trade other cryptos on exchanges. Well, not yet anyway. The bank noted that JPM will run on the Quorum Blockchain at first, and then will be extended to other platforms and will eventually be operable on all standard blockchain networks. What’s interesting to note is JPMorgan’s changing stance on cryptocurrency products. As Reuters reminds us, JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon called Bitcoin a “fraud” in 2017, saying that cryptocurrencies are “worse than tulips bulbs” at the time. He tempered his view a few months later when he said he regretted calling Bitcoin a fraud, but still said he wasn’t interested in the coin. JPMorgan’s position is now in favor of cryptocurrencies as long as “they’re properly controlled and regulated,” according to its presentation page.

The consumer food specialist's announcement didn't do much to change that broader picture of mostly worsening operating results. However, General Mills remained on track to meet its modest fiscal 2019 targets. More on that outlook in a moment. First, here's a look at its headline results. Metric Q2 2019 Q2 2018 Year-Over-Year Change Revenue $4.4 billion $4.2 billion 5% Net income $343 million $431 million (21%) Earnings per share $0.57 $0.74 (23%) Data source: General Mills's financial filings. What happened this quarter? Sales growth got a bit worse, and the company has continued losing money as it restructures its business to account for shifting consumer demand. The broader trends were consistent with management's targets, though, which call for sales growth to begin accelerating over the next few quarters. Children eating cereal. Image source: Getty Images. Here are the key highlights of the quarter. Organic sales trends worsened slightly, slipping 1% compared to a less-than-1% increase in the prior quarter. Overall sales increased 5%, or 7% after accounting for currency exchange shifts, thanks mainly to the recent acquisition of the Blue Buffalo pet food franchise. Reported gross profit margin fell slightly but held steady at 34.5% of sales after one-time costs were accounted for. General Mills was able to boost prices modestly, which, combined with cost cuts, offset the impact from higher input costs. Operating profit slumped by 23% as the company took charges related to its restructuring plan. Things looked better on an adjusted basis, with margin ticking up to 17.3% of sales from 16.9% a year ago, thanks to savings from the restructuring activities. Cash generation was strong as the company beat its goal of converting at least 95% of earnings into free cash flow. Story continues What management had to say Management said its cost-cutting initiatives are paying bigger dividends than originally expected, leading to surprisingly strong adjusted earnings. \"Our cost and capital discipline,\" CEO Jeff Harmening said in a press release, \"has driven profit growth ahead of our expectations in the first half\" of fiscal 2019. \"I'm pleased,\" Harmening continued, \"that our results through six months keep us on track to deliver on our full-year targets.\" Looking forward Harmening and his team are calling for healthy growth from the Blue Buffalo franchise, combined with accelerated sales gains in its core consumer foods business, to produce gains on both the top and bottom lines this fiscal year. That newly acquired pet food brand should allow for overall revenue to rise between 9% and 10% in 2019, executives confirmed, despite a second straight year of flat organic sales. The forecast still implies strengthening results in General Mills's cereal and snack business that investors haven't seen evidence of -- yet. Adjusted earnings, meanwhile, are still on track to rise by less than 2% at the midpoint of guidance. Given the significant losses expected from the restructuring activities, these predictions amount to another transition year for a business that's struggling to get its portfolio of food brands growing again, while protecting profitability against rising commodity costs. It's too early to claim that recovery is taking root, but at least its operating trends are stable heading into the back half of its fiscal year.

Following on from a 0.43% rise from Friday, Bitcoin Cash ABC ended the day at $152.62. A range-bound first half of the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC fall to a morning low $139.8. The days first major support level at $139.12 was left untested, The pullback came ahead of a broad-based cryptomarket rally. Bitcoin Cash ABC rallied through the days major resistance levels and 38.2% FIB of $148 to strike a late in the day intraday high $152.6. The breakout through to $150 levels began the formation of a near-term bullish trend from late Januarys swing lo $105.00. At the time of writing, Bitcoin Cash ABC was up by 2.15% to $155.90. A bullish start to the day saw Bitcoin Cash ABC rise from a morning low $152.5 to a morning high and new swing hi $155.90. The days major support and resistance levels were left untested early on. For the day ahead, a breakthrough to $156 levels would bring the first major resistance level at $156.89 into play. Support from the broader market could see Bitcoin Cash ABC breakout from $156 levels to bring $160 levels into play before any pullback. Barring another crypto-rally, we would expect Bitcoin Cash ABC to come up short of the second major resistance level at $161.17. Failure to break through to $156 levels could see Bitcoin Cash ABC pullback through to $152 levels in the early part of the week. Holding onto $150 levels would be needed to avoid a slide through $148 levels. A fall through $148 would bring the first major support level at $144.07 into play. Litecoin Hits the $50s Litecoin rose by 4.32% on Saturday. Following on from a 1.24% gain from Friday, Litecoin ended the day at $51.19. A bearish start to the day saw Litecoin fall to a late morning intraday low $48.02 before steadying. The pullback saw Litecoin call on support at the first major support level at $48.11. Tracking the broader market through the afternoon, Litecoin rallied to a late intraday high $51.73 before easing back. The move saw Litecoin break through the first major resistance level at $49.87 and second major resistance level at $50.43. Story continues At the time of writing, Litecoin was up by 2.32% to $52.38. A bullish start to the day saw Litecoin rise from a morning low $51.17 to a morning high $52.61 before easing back. The early move saw Litecoin come up against the first major resistance level at $52.61. Litecoin left Support levels untested early on in the day. For the day ahead, a hold onto $52 levels through the morning would support a break back through the first major resistance level. Support from the broader market would bring $53 levels and the second major resistance level at $54.02 into play. Failure to hold onto $52 levels could see Litecoin give up the morning gains. A fall through to $50 levels would be needed, however, to bring sub-$50 levels and the first major support level at $48.90 into play. Barring a broad-based crypto sell-off, we would expect Litecoin to steer clear of sub-$50 levels on the day. Ripple Sees Modest Gains Ripples XRP rose by 3.61% on Saturday. Following on from a 0.55% gain from Friday, Ripples XRP ended the day at $0.34046. A relatively bearish start to the day saw Ripples XRP fall to a mid-morning intraday low $0.32402 before finding support. Steering clear of the days first major support level at $0.3220, rallied to a late afternoon intraday high $0.34291. Ripples XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.3330 and second major resistance level at $0.3375. More notably, Ripples XRP held onto $0.34 levels for the first time since 9 th January. At the time of writing, Ripples XRP was up by 2.21% to $0.3480. Tracking the broader market, Ripples XRP rallied from a morning low $0.33967 to a morning high $0.35178 before easing back. The early rally saw Ripples XRP breakthrough the first major resistance level at $0.3476. For the day ahead, a move back through to $0.35 levels would support another run at the second major resistance level at $0.3547. Barring a broad-based crypto rally, we would expect Ripples XRP to struggle to break out from $0.355 levels on the day. Failure to move back through to $0.35 levels could see Ripples XRP pullback through to $0.33 levels before any recovery. Barring a broad-based crypto reversal, we would expect Ripples XRP to steer clear of $0.32 levels and the first major support level at $0.3287.

Keeping all of his money in bitcoin, he only exchanges small amounts into the hyperinflating bolivar when necessary. Also read: SEC Chair Explains Key Upgrades Needed for Bitcoin ETF Approval Bitcoin Not Bolivar Carlos Hern&#xE1;ndez, a Venezuelan living in Ciudad Guayana, told his story in The New York Times on Saturday about how bitcoin is saving his family throughout the ongoing crisis in Venezuela. Citing the bolivar&#x2019;s daily inflation rate of around 3.5 percent, he wrote: I don&#x2019;t own bol&#xED;vars, Venezuela&#x2019;s official currency. I keep all of my money in bitcoin. Keeping it in bol&#xED;vars would be financial suicide. He explained that he does not have a bank account abroad and &#x201C;With Venezuela&#x2019;s currency controls, there&#x2019;s no easy way for me to use a conventional foreign currency like American dollars.&#x201D; Hern&#xE1;ndez revealed that cryptocurrency has enabled him to cover his household expenses on his own, noting that his father, a government employee, earns $6 a month and his stay-at-home mom has no income. His brother also relies on cryptocurrency. Juan, a 28-year-old lawyer, became a freelancer because &#x201C;in times of hyperinflation, everyone is constantly getting poorer, including a lawyer&#x2019;s clients,&#x201D; Hern&#xE1;ndez detailed. He added that his brother &#x201C;had to turn to cryptocurrencies to get paid&#x201D; because he could not use Paypal, a common way for websites to pay freelancers, due to &#x201C;exchange controls here allow[ing] Venezuelan banks to use only local currency.&#x201D; Moreover, cryptocurrency helped Juan avoid his money being seized at the borders when he tried to move to Colombia. &#x201C;Venezuelan military personnel at the borders have a reputation for seizing the money of people who want to leave,&#x201D; Hern&#xE1;ndez exclaimed. Overall, he concluded: You could say that cryptocurrencies have saved our family. Converting Crypto Into Bolivars In order to buy everyday necessities such as milk, Hern&#xE1;ndez explained that cryptocurrencies must be converted into bolivars. He uses Localbitcoins to find buyers who use the same bank he does so &#x201C;the wire transfer can go through immediately,&#x201D; he said, elaborating: I can&#x2019;t change too many bitcoins at once, though. The government doesn&#x2019;t monitor cryptocurrency transactions (yet), but it does monitor transactions in bol&#xED;vars &#x2014; and any worth about $50 or more will automatically freeze your account until you can explain to your bank where the funds come from. Localbitcoins has been a popular platform for Venezuelans. The trading volume on the exchange has been steadily rising, hitting a record high of 2,487 BTC for the week ending Feb. 9 before settling at 1,939 BTC last week. Another international exchange platform, Paxful, told news.Bitcoin.com last week that it also saw record volume in Venezuela, which increased 74.66 percent compared to last year. In addition, the number of trades on the platform increased by 118 percent to an average of 61,534 transactions monthly. Recently the government of Nicolas Maduro published decrees to regulate crypto activities in Venezuela, including taxing remittances. Charities Using Bitcoin Like Hern&#xE1;ndez, charities in Venezuela have also been able to benefit from bitcoin&#x2019;s borderless nature. One such charity is Bitcoin Venezuela, a nonprofit organization that uses bitcoin to raise funds to aid Venezuelans while offering education in basic economics. For Venezuela&#x2019;s International Children&#x2019;s Day last year, the nonprofit&#x2019;s humanitarian aid project collected bitcoin donations from Paxful and others. It then gave food to a soup kitchen that feeds 1,500 people daily, two orphanages, and distributed hundreds of meals to people on the street. On Feb. 10, Eatbch, a Venezuelan nonprofit food drive powered by bitcoin cash, celebrated its one-year anniversary. Within a few months of launch, the charity was &#x201C;giving thousands of meals each week in 23 locations in 6 states of the country,&#x201D; its co-founder described.

Whatever your vice, your potion, or your whimsy, odds are there&#x2019;s a darknet vendor who&#x2019;s selling it in exchange for cryptocurrency. Unlike the closely regulated clearnet, the darknet remains a largely lawless frontier, where everything has its price and anything can be acquired with few questions asked. Also read: Mt. Gox CEO Claims the Coinlab and Brock Pierce Deals Never Materialized Eclectic Wares for Purveyors of the Esoteric Dream is the largest and longest running of the DNMs. Like its peers, it mostly sells drugs, but there are also other wares to be had including a plethora of digital and physical goods. For $7.28, or its bitcoin equivalent, one Dream vendor will supply you with a PDF version of &#x201C;22 Ways To Kill a Man With Your Bare Hands.&#x201D; For those with a little more crypto to burn, $150 of BTC or BCH will furnish you with an extreme power laser pointer. The 20,000 MW device comes with a warning that it can burn targets, so wield it with care. Wallstreet Market is another DNM where pharmaceuticals of all kinds are the primary stock in trade. There are plenty of other goods to be had over and above these victuals however. The anonymity starter pack, for instance, promises 24 ebooks that cover everything from encryption to privacy. Each book is priced at $1.99 and provides all the resources you need to start your own vendor account on the darknet, should you be so inclined. Over on Berlusconi Market, some of what glitters is gold &#x2013; or at least so its vendors claim. In addition to gold bars, there are Berlusconi vendors selling powdered gold, also known as flour gold, by the gram or the ounce. Payment is accepted in BTC, LTC and XMR. Other wares for sale on Berlusconi include a .edu Gmail address, which can be yours for less than $6. Drugs Still Dominate the Darknet The darknet rose to prominence thanks to drugs marketplaces like Silk Road, and to this day drugs remain the primary trade of the DNMs. While cannabis is now legal in numerous global regions, including several U.S. states, other recreational drugs remain illegal in most countries. As such, customers should be mindful of the laws in their territory and how this might impact their ability to purchase certain wares when browsing the darknet. Over on Cannazon, for example, which stocks cannabis-based wares only, listings include THC-infused gummies, chocolates and other edibles. The marketplace accepts BTC and XMR. While the majority of wares for sale on the darknet are illegal, many DNM advocates believe these marketplaces serve a vital role in facilitating the safe purchase of narcotics from vendors whose reliability and reputation can be assessed.

In the last few weeks, projects like Wormhole and the Simple Ledger Protocol (SLP) have seen a significant amount of token creation, alongside a variety of wallet support for the many tokens the community has already created.

Gox CEO Claims the Coinlab and Brock Pierce Deals Never Materialized VOTE, FLC and KTB Among The New BCH Tokens For a while now BCH programmers have been developing projects that aim to bolster the token ecosystem built on top of the Bitcoin Cash network. Over the last couple of months, individuals and organizations such as the social media application Honest Cash have been creating special tokens for various purposes. For example, a look at the Bitcoin.com Block Explorer shows a ton of people have been creating their own coins. Tokens created so far have names like Vote (VOTE), Useless (USL), Killthebeast (KTB), Falcon (FLC), Official SLP Token (SLP), Berniecoin (BERN), and Dogecash (DOGE). News.Bitcoin.com also recently reported on the latest Badger client release that just added Wormhole and SLP token support.

The problem is that to get in on the action, investors often have to pay a premium thanks to the hype and tantalizing potential returns for a young company with years of growth ahead of it. Over the past three months, the markets have taken a significant step back, and that's sent shares ofCarvana Co.(NYSE: CVNA)andControl4 Corp(NASDAQ: CTRL)48% and 51% lower, respectively. Here's why these two stocks are amazing growth stories for investors willing to buy when others are fearful.\nCarvana is a used car retailer with an online car-buying platform that replaces the traditional dealership infrastructure and offers as-soon-as-next-day delivery or pickup at one of the company's automated car vending machines. Let's highlight why Carvana is an amazing growth stock for 2019 by digging into its revenue growth, gross profit expansion, and enticing long-term potential.\nDespite Carvana's 48% decline over the past three months, its business has been nothing short of impressive. Consider that during the third quarter, management reported a 116% growth in retail units, 137% growth in total revenue, and a 181% increase in total GAAP gross profit. It marked the 19th consecutive quarter of triple-digit unit and revenue growth, and it's all but certain to make it a 20th consecutive quarter when the book is closed on 2018. Carvana now operates in 85 markets, and it increased its number of market openings from 23 during 2017 to roughly 40 in 2018 -- that expansion can't continue at that pace long term, but expect plenty of new markets in the years ahead.\nCarvana has posted excellent top-line growth and will boost that further by entering new markets, but just as important, if not more, is the work it's doing to boost gross profit per unit (GPU). Carvana achieved its highest ever quarterly total GPU in the third quarter, reaching $2,302 per unit. Carvana's GPU is taking steps toward its $3,000 target, and it can increase that in the near term by reducing days to sale and lowering its advertising in maturing markets.\nImage source: Carvana's November Analyst Day presentation.\nRemember, as recently as the first quarter of 2018, Carvana's GPU was $1,854, and through reduced days to sale, an increase in retail cars sourced from customers, an increase in wholesale cars sold, and a lower cost of funds on financing and new products and services, among others, management will continue to sell more cars in more markets, more profitably. It's also important to understand that Carvana has tracked declining advertising expenses per unit the longer it operates in a market thanks to word of mouth increasing brand awareness.\nThose figures and examples show that Carvana has plenty of top- and bottom-line growth potential, but how big is its overall growth story? What some investors don't realize is that the automotive industry is highly fragmented. Automotive dealers are the largest consumer retail vertical, with 2017 industry sales topping $1 trillion. Consider how massive the auto dealers industry is compared to the next three largest retail industries: general merchandise stores ($692 billion), grocery stores ($639 billion), and electronic shopping and mail-order houses ($545 billion). But here's the interesting part: The largest company per market share in automotive dealers wasCarMax(NYSE: KMX)at 2%. Compare that toWalmartwith a 54% share in general merchandise,Krogerwith 18% in grocery, andAmazonwith 19% in electronic shopping, and you get the sense of how large Carvana could grow if it becomes a dominant retailer and can exploit its growing scale and e-commerce reach.\nCarvana investors will certainly face speed bumps within the cyclical automotive industry, but if you focus on the long road ahead, the company has immense potential to grow its market share in a fractured industry while improving the profitability of its retail sales.\nThere are few certainties in the world of business and investing, especially when your horizon is decades rather than quarters. However, barring a zombie apocalypse, we can almost certainly say the number of smart and/or connected devices in our life will increase in number, and also in complexity. The exploding number of smart devices in the smart home is great news forControl4, aglobal leading provider of smart-home solutionsand named the leading whole-house automation brand by 2018 CE Pro Brand Analysis.\nAs smart homes increase in complexity, more and more consumers will turn to professional installations from companies such as Control4, and its dealership network. According to the 2017 True Cost Report from Home Advisor, 40% of millennial homeowners say they'll hire a pro for every project, and 53% of baby boomers said the same. Per the same report, about seven years from now, we should see a bump in increased demand among millennials for professional home services.\nIt's certainly positive for Control4 that consumers are expected to increasingly turn to professional installs, but the company needs to focus on a couple of factors to make sure it grows into its massive potential -- management estimates Control4 has penetrated only 1.6% of U.S. households generating over $150,000 in annual income. Those two things are as follows: Keep a healthy balance sheet for acquisitions, and grow brand awareness through showrooms.\nLet's cover Control4's brand awareness strategy first. While the company focuses on smart-home solutions, it's yet to become a widely known household name. It hopes to change that in the coming years with its launch of 150 new certified showrooms spanning five countries and 25 markets. The idea is simple: Wow potential consumers with visual demonstrations of world-class, professionally installed smart-home solutions. Control4 is in the early innings of a long-term smart-home growth story, and right now, the company needs to show consumers how much value these systems can add to their lives, homes, and businesses. Not only will showrooms help spread brand awareness and enlighten consumers about the value Control4 systems provide, it should increase sales leads and conversions of those leads.\nImage source: Control4.\nBeyond spreading the good gospel of its products, Control4 also has to be nimble in such a rapidly evolving smart-home story. Management needs a balance sheet that's able to pounce on a young business that it can fold into its offerings to improve revenue, add innovative products, or bring in top-level talent.\nImage source: Control4's November Investor Presentation.\nHere's the good news: Control4 ended the third quarter with $91 million of cash,no debtand $40 million in unused line of credit. That leaves the company flexible to continue scooping up valuable bolt-on businesses that can help drive brand awareness and revenue, and keep it as a leading provider of innovative smart-home solutions.\nInvestors considering Control4 and Carvana need to understand that both companies will face speed bumps, similar to the landscape over the past three months, which sent their respective stocks tumbling roughly 50%. Carvana will face pessimism regarding the broader automotive industry as it enters a down cycle, and Control4 could struggle to produce impressive enough top-line growth as it expands its showrooms to grow brand awareness and sales leads. However, if Carvana continues to expand in a highly fragmented market, and Control4 becomes a household name and expands overseas, both are amazing growth stocks heading into 2019 and beyond.\nMore From The Motley Fool\n• 3 Growth Stocks at Deep-Value Prices\n• 5 Expected Social Security Changes in 2018\n• 6 Years Later, 6 Charts That Show How Far Apple, Inc.

There is almost 100 times the level of competition today as there was four years ago, up 125 exahashes from 1.4 exahashes.After the last halving in 2016, 16nm chips were first hitting the market, pushing 14 terahashes per second, or T/s, at an efficiency of 100 watts per terahash. Since then, 10nm, 7nm and now 5nm chips have switched on, with over 100 T/s now consuming just 30 W/T. Advancements in chip design and fabrication have more than doubled the efficiency of ASICs, and are nearly 100 times as powerful. While 5nm chips are only just beginning to join the network, the 7nm chip market has been expanding for a couple of years, forcing 16nm and 10nm chips to find cheaper electricity or capitulate. Mining operations have branched out internationally across energy markets, seeking cheaper electricity to widen profit margins and prolong the lifespan of their machines. Mining is a long game about survival.There has been a great deal of discussion lately on how Bitcoin’s upcoming halving (less than two weeks away!) will affect the mining industry in the coming months. There is little doubt among researchers and industry experts that the hashrate is going to drop significantly when the block subsidy gets cut in half. Blockware Solutions recently released a report arguing that the halving will lighten sell pressure as older equipment and higher electricity costs squeeze out inefficient competitors.The question is, how much hashrate will go offline? As pool operators, we don’t receive any information on miners’ electricity costs, so we can’t know exactly what that number will be, but by breaking down hashrate distribution, we can look at which miners have the highest risk of shutting down.Below, you can see the lower quartile of total hashrate divided into two-terahash intervals. Each section of the pie chart represents the percentages of total output for each range in the lower quartile.We’re looking particularly at the lower quartile of the network hashrate because this is the highest risk area, where miners’ profit margins are tightest. The range from 0–25 T/s represents the majority of the 16nm and 10nm chips, many of which are likely to capitulate once the block subsidy is halved. The most popular miner that was sold in the last four years was Bitmain’s S9, of which there are many versions, but they all fall between 12–22 T/s. The standard S9 produces 13.5 T/s, which probably accounts for the majority of miners in the 12–14 T/s range.We estimate that the miners in this range account for approximately 15% to 30% of the Bitcoin network’s overall hashrate. While we expect that most of them will shut down after the halving, it is likely that some have cheap enough electricity to survive in the near future.There are three changing variables that miners need to compare when calculating profitability: revenue, costs and difficulty. The price of Bitcoin and the block reward set the upper bound for income revenue. The halving of the block reward has the same effect on a miner’s revenue as halving the United States dollar price of Bitcoin. The recent price rally since hitting a yearly low means there could be room for wider profit margins in the short term if prices continue to rise. However, if the price were to drop, then inefficient miners will be squeezed out faster.By comparing the break-even prices of miners across the lower quartile, we can see at what prices older miners will no longer be profitable. In order to compare break-even prices, we have to take the current difficulty and price into consideration. In the graph below, we suppose Bitcoin is at a price of $7,000 with the current difficulty.The highest that any of these can pay for electricity and remain profitable after the halving is $0.034 per kWh. The lowest ranges operating at 0–10 T/s will all be leaving unless they have virtually free electricity and no other overhead costs. If we take the ranges with the largest percentages of hashrate, between 10–16 T/s, only the Antminer S9K barely breaks even at 3 cents per kWh. At 46%, this range represents nearly half of all hash-power mining in this range, most of which will need to mine below $0.02 per kWh to remain profitable after the halving. There are very few places that can offer such cheap electricity. Even the rates from hydroelectric dams in Szechuan, China during the rainy season are well above these breakeven costs. Even if some of these miners are able to survive with sub-$0.02 electricity, their margins will be so thin that if the difficulty continues to increase, they will eventually be phased out due to producing such miniscule profits. It is likely that most of the hashrate in this range will be lost from the outset.Some of the miners from 16–26 T/s may be able to remain profitable a little longer after the difficulty adjusts downward, with more breakeven prices between $0.03 and $0.035 cents per kWh. However, these again will be razor-thin margins, which also makes these miners vulnerable to falling off in the short term. While there may be some that are able to remain working given cheap enough electricity, we estimate that less than 15% of the lower quartile will remain.The upcoming and final difficulty adjustment with the 12.5 BTC block subsidy will occur one week before the halving (1008 blocks), and the difficulty is projected to increase. We expect that the first 1008 blocks after the halving will be mined slowly as huge numbers of unprofitable miners drop off the network. We estimate that closer to 30% will be squeezed considering that the first 1008 blocks will have the pre-halving difficulty, but half the reward.After the first difficulty adjustment, some older miners may turn back on, but as new, more efficient ASICs come online in the coming months and existing miners find lower electricity prices, old generation miners will inevitably be phased out. Many of the older 7nm chips will take the place of cheap power, where 16nm and 10nm chips will have been just scraping by, while new 5nm chips will profit at higher electricity costs and apply more pressure downwards. There will undoubtedly be a series of fluctuations as new hashrate pushes out older equipment, stabilizes and then continues to move up.The beginning of this mining epoch provides new miners an opportunity to enter a more stable environment, given that efficiencies in 5nm chips will likely remain profitable for the next four years or longer as we run up against the edge of Moore’s Law in how thin silicon wafers can go. New entrants can therefore have a clear picture of what the mining landscape will look like for the next four years.The views, thoughts and opinions expressed here are the author’s alone and do not necessarily reflect or represent the views and opinions of Cointelegraph.Alejandro De La Torre is a staunch believer in the financial freedom that Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies will bring to humanity.

On-chain data may hold the answer.', 'As the coronavirus pandemic continues to unfold and new signs of lockdowns beginning to be slowly lifted in Europe, all eyes in the crypto community are back on the Bitcoin (BTC) halving. The event is only 10 days away, and Bitcoin’s price seems to be acting accordingly, having surged an incredible 23% to a monthly high above $9,400 earlier this week.\\xa0A widely celebrated event in the cryptocurrency industry, the halving is part of the Bitcoin monetary policy, in which every four years, the Bitcoin mining reward is cut in half. This means that on May 11, 6.25 BTC will be issued every 10 minutes, instead of the current 12.5 BTC.\\xa0The upcoming halving will be the third since Bitcoin’s inception, and the event brings with it some bullish views for the asset’s value.\\xa0According to PlanB, the creator of the much-discussed “Stock to Flow” model, the reduction in Bitcoin’s issuance rate is bound to increase BTC’s price in the long-run. Recently, the analyst said in a tweet:“IMO #bitcoin 2020 halving will be like 2012 & 2016. As per S2F model I expect 10x price (order of magnitude, not precise) 1–2 yrs after the halving. Halving will be make-or-break for S2F model. I hope this halving will teach us more about underlying fundamentals & network effects.”Opinions are mixed when it comes to the price action after the halving, however. Some believe it will undoubtedly bring higher prices while others believe that this factor is already accounted for in the current prices, given that it’s publicly available knowledge. Other investors disregard the importance of miners and the reward issuance, as they are convinced that speculation is the sole driver of Bitcoin’s price.Bitcoin mining activity warrants observationWhile speculation is a driving force for Bitcoin’s price when it comes to certain bullish or bearish cycles, supply and demand is always at play. Miners are extremely important when it comes to understanding Bitcoin’s price, as they’re the single suppliers of new coins in the market.\\xa0Miners create cons...\n- Bitcoin News: [[386823, '2020-05-01 21:28:30', 'UK Cryptocurrency Firms Turn to Equity Funding as ICO Coffers Plunge 70%', 'uk-cryptocurrency-firms-turn-to-equity-funding-as-ico-coffers-plunge-70', 'Jeffrey Gogo', 'UK cryptocurrency and blockchain startups are turning focus back to conventional means of raising capital, as initial coin offering (ICO) coffers dry up. According to a new report, initial coin offering (ICO) funding last year plunged 71% to £200 million ($250 million) from £700 million ($875 million) a year earlier. By comparison, equity funding provided £168 million ($210 million) to startups in 2019, almost the same as the year before, says the report by venture capital firm MMC Ventures. In 2017, only £100 million was raised this way. Altogether, equity financing has supported emerging UK crypto businesses to the tune of £525 million since 2013. &#8220;As the ICO funding model becomes increasingly difficult, companies are shifting back to traditional capital raising strategies. This has prompted founders to place more focus on company fundamentals,&#8221; said MMC Ventures. UK cryptocurrency entrepreneurs had scripted a promising success story over the past few years, with over 2,700 companies founded since 2008, the year of the Bitcoin whitepaper. But only 9% of the startups raised money by means of the sale of shares, as ICOs proved popular, until the bubble burst in 2018. The report states that ICOs failed in the UK because &#8220;the majority were not interested in creating long-term value.&#8221; Equity financing demands that projects build a strong infrastructure foundation and business case. MMC Ventures said: While capital is less abundant than it was during the ICO bubble, resources are being deployed more efciently and targeted at fundamental areas of the technology stack. The company expects funding for UK startups to slow down through 2020 and beyond due to the coronavirus crisis. But expressed optimism that &#8220;the increasingly pragmatic, business-case-first approach of the teams in the blockchain/crypto space makes them relatively well-positioned to weather this downturn&#8230;&#8221; What do you think about the future of funding for crypto startups?

Onchain data and blockchain analysis firms indicate that the number of bitcoin whales with 1,000 to 10,000 BTC or more on a single address has increased significantly. Small and Mega-Bitcoin Whales Accumulate More Coins During the Market Dip In the cryptocurrency world, investors who hold a large number of digital assets are typically called &#x2018;whales.&#x2019; There are also all types of whales like BTC whales, ETH whales, and BCH whales. The definition of a BTC whale would be a person or organization (a single address) with around 1,000 BTC or more. Whales with around 1,000 BTC would be considered small whales and at the time of publication, there are 2,002 addresses with 1K BTC or more. Onchain data from December 17, 2018 (1,754) until May 1, 2020, shows these smaller whales grew by 14.13%. Then there are mega-whales who own 10,000 BTC or more, which is around $87 million using today&#x2019;s exchange rates. Onchain BTC data on December 17, 2018, and February 25, 2019. Onchain data from December 17, 2018, shows at the time there were 91 addresses with 10,000 BTC or more. Today&#x2019;s statistics show there are now 106 addresses with 10,000+ BTC. The data highlights that whales with 10K BTC or more have grown by 16.48% since the end of 2018. On February 25, 2019, there were 1,709 addresses with 1,000 BTC or more. Since then, the increase of smaller whales has been around 17.14%. Similarly, on the same day in February 2019, there were 100 addresses and the increase to 106 would be approximately 6%. Bitcoin Addresses With 100 and 100,000 Bitcoins Decreased Then there are even bigger whales than the 10K BTC holders, as there are three addresses with anywhere between 100,000 to 1,000,000 BTC today. A whale address that has 100K BTC is worth around $873 million at today&#x2019;s exchange rates. Back in December 2018, there were more 100K or more addresses than today, as five of them held these balances. Fast forward to February 2019, and the number remained the same with only five addresses holding 100K BTC. Of course, most of these 100K addresses belong to exchanges that hold BTC in a custodial fashion for their customers. There are all types of whales. Some say small whales own over 1,000 coins, and mega whales own 10,000+. There are only three bitcoin addresses that hold 100,000 BTC or more today. Back in December 2018 and February 2019, there were 5 addresses with 100K BTC or more. Now the much smaller investor, with 100 BTC or more is around 14,000 addresses on May 1, 2020. In December 2018, there were 14,809 addresses with 100 BTC or more, and on February 25, 2019, that number dipped to 14749 addresses. So these types of holders have decreased and it is possible they sold to the much larger whales during the last few months. On March 12, 2020, otherwise known as &#x2018;Black Thursday,&#x2019; BTC prices dropped to $3,600 per coin. Reports from popular exchanges like Kraken, Binance, and Coinbase explained that there was a massive amount of buyers during the 24 hours that followed the market rout. The San Francisco exchange Coinbase wrote a blog post on how crypto investors bought the crypto asset when it was much lower in value. Even the famed whistleblower Edward Snowden said he felt like buying the dip. What do you think about the bitcoin whale accumulation?

They made many bad decisions and failed to focus on what made 2.x great.\\n\\n3.x is a mess compared to 2.x and I dont think anyone would disagree.\\n\\nThe big problem the haters seem to have with 2.x, mainly 2.2.1 since most hardcore uTorrent users use it, is that old equals bad.\\n\\nIt is old therefore it *must* have active exploits, but of course there are none known (and uTorrent 2.2.1 has beaten at least three absurdly critical failures that the more modern clients including 3.x have had thanks to 2.2.1's excellent design).\\n\\nThe thread in r/piracy is an example of this. You get linked old exploits that were fixed well before 2.2.1 (and were really just potential crashes anyway, not actual exploits) and you get linked the json-rpc issue that never actually worked on uTorrent 2.2.1 and never crashed 2.2.1 either.\\n\\nIn the case of 3.x it should be shunned but 2.2.1 works better than anything. There are clients that use slightly less resources, cli based ones, but most use far more; none of the other clients is as fast as uTorrent 2.2.1 in connecting to swarms or reaching top speed or sustaining top speed and the cli clients are smashed by uTorrent 2.2.1's speed.\\n\\nThat last point is one you can test for yourself. Download a test torrent or a linux distro with 2.2.1 then try one of the other clients they like. See which is faster.\\n\\nI think this is what they hate most. The fact that you can say to them 'go test for yourself to see which is faster' and we all know before they do those tests that uTorrent 2.2.1 is going to win. :)\\n\\n&gt; Edit: what’s with all the people downvoting but not replying\\n\\nlol, I usually get lots of downvotes when I defend 2.2.1 and laugh at how qBit et al had all these vulnerabilities that were shockingly bad.\\n\\nThey usually dont bother posting arguments as they dont have any.\", 'gb8sxc'], ['u/EdwardAlphonse31011', 15, '2020-05-01 07:44', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/torrents/comments/gb8sxc/whats_with_the_utorrent_hate/fp4zquk/', \"For me it's literally the Bitcoin farming **malware** .

German bank BayernLB predicted last year that bitcoin’s halving could drive its price to $90,000 , roughly 12 times the current level. Cryptocurrency markets got a sneak preview on Wednesday as a lesser coin, bitcoin cash (BCH), went through its own halving. Spoiler alert: There wasn’t much to see.

Bitcoin cash prices rose 5.9 percent Wednesday, entirely in line with its trading range on most days. Cryptocurrencies have been volatile since long before the coronavirus hit. Bitcoin climbed 2.3 percent on the day. “In crypto, that’s normal,” Roger Ver, executive chairman of Bitcoin.com and a key proponent of bitcoin cash, said in an audio interview over Telegram from his home in St. Kitts. Related: Profit-Taking Keeps Bitcoin in Tight Range as Fed Reopens Spigot Ver says he hadn’t been expecting much from the event. He’s been around the crypto industry since the early days, and witnessed bitcoin’s halvings in 2012 and 2016. This week’s halving was the first for bitcoin cash, which split off from bitcoin in 2017. “A leap year happens every four years,” Ver said. “Life goes on. Nobody cares. After you’ve been through one leap year, it’s not interesting or exciting anymore.” Story continues The episode offers a dose of reality for crypto-industry newcomers who might be looking forward to something spectacular when bitcoin’s next halving arrives in May. It’s so hotly anticipated that clever web designers have erected pages featuring countdown clocks. As of the latest look, it’ll take place in an estimated 34 days, seven hours and 47 minutes. (On May 13, around 09:25 UTC.) If bitcoin cash’s halving is any guide, there really won’t be much to see. Maybe champagne glasses will clink somewhere, celebrating the passage of another four years of bitcoin’s remarkable existence since it was created in early 2009 atop what is now the world’s largest blockchain network. See CoinDesk Research’s report on the bitcoin halving Bitcoin’s price, currently around $7,300, has climbed 20-fold since the start of 2015, the first full year of historical data from the popular cryptocurrency exchange Coinbase. There were a lot of days between then and now, many of them up, many of them down, and only one of those days in 2016 coincided with a halving. Blockchains like the ones powering bitcoin and bitcoin cash rely on high-speed computer operators and data centers known as “miners,” which collectively process quintillions of computations per second in an effort to maintain and protect the security and integrity of the network. To keep the miners affixed over the long term, according to Ver, “the price only has to double once every four years.” “I’ve always said that the price is the least interesting thing about cryptocurrencies,” Ver said. “The price is just a side effect of the amount of adoption you’re getting in the world.” Four years is quite a span – enough to frustrate investors, analysts and researchers who might prefer to clearly quantify the price impact of past halvings, or of the upcoming halving. Just think back to how much has happened in cryptocurrency markets in the past six months: Chinese President Xi Jinping said the world’s largest economy would “ seize the opportunities ” afforded by blockchain technology. (Bitcoin jumped 12 percent.) The U.S. killed a top Iranian general , threatening to escalate into a war. (Up 10 percent.) The coronavirus came along. (Bitcoin plunged, then recovered , and is now up 2 percent year-to-date.) “The market’s always pricing in everything,” Ver said. With many investors seeing bitcoin as a potential hedge against inflation – a digital and more portable form of gold, as it were – the unprecedented trillions of dollars of coronavirus-related aid and stimulus might ultimately make the halving an afterthought. Unlike the coronavirus, after all, the halving was telegraphed years in advance. Blockware Solutions, which brokers high-speed computers used for cryptocurrency mining, wrote Wednesday in an e-mail that price is “not just supply side economics,” but demand. “Bitcoin has the most robust ecosystem in the blockchain industry, and the fundamentals continuously improve due to the global macro improving sentiment and accelerating demand,” according to the note. The point was that bitcoin watchers shouldn’t draw too many conclusions from bitcoin cash’s halving. Rich Rosenblum, a former managing director of Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs who now oversees markets at the digital-asset trading firm GSR, noted bitcoin cash prices usually trade in sync with bitcoin’s – similar to the way gold and silver prices track, as do oil and gasoline. “The bitcoin halving in a month is going to have more impact on bitcoin cash than the bitcoin cash halving,” he said in a phone interview. Bitcoin cash’s halving took place at 12:19 UTC, when the blockchain network reached block number 630,000. The most immediate impact was also, perhaps, the most visible: The next data block took nearly two hours to close, well beyond the average of about 10 minutes. According to Ver, that probably happened because miners reallocated their computational power toward suddenly more profitable blockchains like Bitcoin and Bitcoin SV. The Bitcoin Cash protocol has a feature that automatically adjusts the difficulty of mining a new data block when there’s a sudden scarcity of miners; the mechanism is designed to lure some back. Block 630,001 took just 16 minutes to close, the data show. Just like adding an extra day to the calendar every four years, these halvings have to happen to make everything work right. So when bitcoin’s halving comes, will it be time to pop the champagne? Why not. Will it be entertaining? Better have YouTube queued up, just in case. Tweet of the day Bitcoin watch BTC : Price: $7,327 ( BPI ) | 24-Hr High: $7,399 | 24-Hr Low: $7,210 Trend : Bitcoin has found acceptance above the three-day 200-candle average and looks set to extend the ongoing rally toward $8,000. That would bring prices back to a level seen ahead of the massive sell-off on March 12. The cryptocurrency is changing hands near $7,312 at press time, while the long-term average is now located at $7,093. As seen on the three-day chart, the bulls repeatedly failed to keep gains above the crucial average in the three weeks to April 5, before flipping the hurdle into support during in the last few days. The breakout may prompt more buyers to join the market, leading to stronger price gains. Supporting the bullish case is the three-day chart MACD histogram’s crossover above zero, a confirmation of bearish-to-bullish trend change. The bullish case would be neutralized if the spot price drops below $7,050, violating the ascending trendline connecting the March 13 and March 30 lows.

We will be looking at previous day price action and todays support, resistance, and pivot levels and, when in play, the Fibonaccis. Ethereum (ETH) Ethereum (ETH) fell by 2.05% on Friday. Following a 1.59% decline on Thursday, Ethereum ended the day at $3,876. A mixed morning saw Ethereum rise to an early morning intraday high $3,995 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $4,065, Ethereum slid to an early afternoon intraday low $3,699. The extended sell-off saw Ethereum fall through the first major support level at $3,901 and the second major support level at $3,845. Significantly, Ethereum also briefly fell through the 23.6% FIB of $3,738. Finding support at the third major support level at $3,682, however, Ethereum revisited $3,900 levels before easing back. The first major support level at $3,901 pegged Ethereum back late in the day. At the time of writing, Ethereum was down by 0.35% to $3,862. A mixed start to the day saw Ethereum rise to an early morning high $3,888 before falling to a low $3,862. Ethereum left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead Ethereum would need to avoid the $3,857 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $4,014 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Ethereum to break back through to $4,000 levels. Barring an extended rally, the first major resistance level should limit the upside. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ethereum could test resistance at $4,300 levels before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $4,152. A fall through the $3,857 pivot would bring the 23.6% FIB of $3,738 and the first major support level at $3,718 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ethereum should steer clear of the second major support level at $3,561. Looking at the Technical Indicators First Major Support Level: $3,718 Story continues Pivot Level: $3,857 First Major Resistance Level: $4,014 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $3,738 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $3,039 62% FIB Retracement Level: $1,909 Litecoin Litecoin (LTC) fell by 3.18% on Friday. Following a 3.14% loss on Thursday, Litecoin ended the day at $144.12. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise to an early morning intraday high $150.35 before hitting reverse. Falling short of the first major resistance level at $154, Litecoin slid to an early afternoon intraday low $141.27. The extended sell-off saw Litecoin fall through the first major support level at $146 and the second major support level at $143. Finding mid-afternoon support, however, Litecoin briefly revisited $149 levels before falling back through the first major support level to end the day at sub-$145 levels. At the time of writing, Litecoin was down by 0.40% to $143.55. A mixed start to the day saw Litecoin rise to an early morning high $144.56 before falling to a low $143.45. Litecoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead Litecoin would need to move through the $145 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $149 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Litecoin to break out from $145 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Fridays high $150.35 would likely cap the upside. In the event of an extended rally, Litecoin could test the second major resistance level at $154. Failure to move through the $145 pivot would bring the first major support level at $140 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, Litecoin should steer clear of sub-$140 levels. The second major support level sits at $136. Looking at the Technical Indicators First Major Support Level: $140 Pivot Level: $145 First Major Resistance Level: $154 23.6% FIB Retracement Level: $178 38.2% FIB Retracement Level: $223 62% FIB Retracement Level: $296 Ripples XRP Ripples XRP fell by 0.91% on Friday. Following a 2.62% decline on Thursday, Ripples XRP ended the day at $0.79698. A bullish start to the day saw Ripples XRP rise to an early morning intraday high $0.83128 before hitting reverse. Ripples XRP broke through the first major resistance level at $0.8259 before sliding to an early afternoon intraday low $0.77604. The extended sell-off saw Ripples XRP fall through the first major support level at $0.7942 and the second major support level at $0.7835. Finding early afternoon support, however, Ripples XRP revisited $0.81 levels before falling back to sub-$0.80 levels. At the time of writing, Ripples XRP was down by 0.30% to $0.79458. A bearish start to the day saw Ripples XRP fall from an early morning high $0.79869 to a low $0.78458. Ripples XRP left the major support and resistance levels untested early on. For the day ahead Ripples XRP would need to move through the $0.8014 pivot to bring the first major resistance level at $0.8268 into play. Support would be needed, however, for Ripples XRP to break out from $0.81 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and Fridays high $0.83128 would likely cap the upside. In the event of a broad-based crypto rally, Ripples XRP could test resistance at the 23.6% FIB of $0.8533 before any pullback. The second major resistance level sits at $0.8567. Failure to move through the $0.8014 pivot would bring the first major support level at $0.7716 into play. Barring another extended sell-off, however, Ripples XRP should steer clear of sub-$0.75 levels.

Coinbase adds nearly 100 crypto assets for trading in 2021', '2021-12-18 19:21:00', 'DeFi projects, decentralized exchange tokens, stablecoins and NFT gaming: What underpins Coinbase’s extensive token-listing activity this year? ', 'As of today, Coinbase has 139 tradable assets. The exchange added a whopping 83 assets to its trading list in 2021, nearly double the number of assets it had accumulated in the eight years since its founding.\\xa0Is this rapid expansion a simple cash-grab? Are any of these lesser-known tokens and coins securities? Is this irresponsible or overly ambitious? What does this rapid expansion of assets by Coinbase mean? A money grab?I feel the answer to the first question is an emphatic “No!” Coinbase is making a lot of money on trading fees, but its token list expansion is not about the money. Coinbase started out with a small booth at a conference “just trying to make something that customers wanted,” pitching T-shirts and a hosted Bitcoin (BTC) wallet. Now, Coinbase is the second-largest crypto exchange in the world. It’s a common tale that an entrepreneur builds something, finds success, sells and moves on, but Coinbase founder and CEO Bryan Armstrong was manning that small booth eight years ago, and is still at Coinbase today. The exchange stays true to its — and Armstrong’s — core values: economic freedom, property rights, a more efficient global system of exchange, and in my opinion, just building the things that customers want.Back in June of this year, Armstrong posted a series of tweets indicating Coinbase’s change of approach to determining which assets get listed. To sum it up, Coinbase shifted from a merit-based approach depending on internal criteria to a pragmatic approach based on externalities. This new approach allows the market to decide which assets have the most value — as it should be. Reminder: Do your own research, even if it is a Coinbase listing.Securities?Coinbase acknowledges and accepts its leadership role in shepherding in new regulation that is beneficial to the new economy. The exchange really does seem to be aware of its leadership role in the crypto space, and works hard on compliance. It therefore wouldn’t make sense for Coinbase to list a gang of assets that might provoke regulators (in the United States, “nonaccredited” investors are barred from early project investment).While the Securities and Exchange Commission is treating stablecoins as securities, Coinbase’s listing parade has continued almost weekly. It is very likely that there are assets added to Coinbase’s trade pairs that the SEC would deem securities. However, the barriers that currently exist in the name of “investor protection” may finally be coming down. Coinbase’s aggressive listing activity squares with the economic freedom, strong property rights, and core values that it supports, and may even hint at undisclosed policy being discussed privately.As Melissa Strait, chief compliance officer at Coinbase, pointed out:“We’ve always believed that for crypto to gain the legitimacy needed for mainstream adoption, compliance can’t be an afterthought — it has to be core to the way we operate.”She also added: “We strongly believe that in order for cryptocurrency to gain widespread acceptance, we must have a constructive relationship with the regulators and agencies that have been charged with oversight of the crypto ecosystem.”Nearly all the assets listed this year are ERC-20 tokens on the Ethereum network. Why? Because they would be deemed “sufficiently decentralized.” This phrase is taken from a speech that William Hinman (former director of the SEC’s Division of Corporation Finance) made in June 2018. So long as an asset is as decentralized as Etherum was on the day of that speech, it is informally and tentatively not considered a security. Thank you, Hinman! Irresponsible or overly ambitious?If there is one thing I have observed in researching this topic, it is that Coinbase is very organized and process-driven. I guess it should be obvious, considering its success. Coinbase’s team is aware of the legal circumstances in which the exchange operates, and has built decision-making systems designed to keep pace with this breakneck industry. Armstrong himself said that he wants to on-board a billion customers. Now that’s ambitious! Overly, though? Not if you believe in a free and open financial system beyond the control of any central actor.Coinbase claims to be “agnostic” on listing tokens. That is, Coinbase doesn’t make any judgement on the projects it lists, but rewards the builders that check all of the boxes of its listing criteria. It is interesting to see the mix of projects that are making it onto the Coinbase platform. After all, a Coinbase listing is like making it to the big leagues. What now?Coinbase listed 16 DeFi projects in 2021. It doesn’t come at a shock that decentralized finance takes the top spot. First-layer projects came in second place with 12 — again not really a surprise, as everyone wants to be the next Ethereum. In third place were eight decentralized exchange tokens, while tied in fourth place were stablecoins and NFT gaming, each with seven projects. Taking fifth place were layer-two Ethereum projects.Coinbase really stepped on the gas this year. It can mean any number of things depending on who you ask. For me, it is a very bullish sign for the overall industry. Coinbase is giving its customers what they want: more choices and more opportunities to find that undervalued gem. It’s up to each individual to do their own due diligence. What some would call the most “user-friendly” platform around is providing access to a decent number of assets now. Having the freedom of choice is a responsibility — choose wisely, or you may find that the SEC will feel the need to choose for you.This article does not contain investment advice or recommendations.

Maja Hitij/Getty Images Tesla will start to let people buy some of its merchandise with dogecoin, Elon Musk said Tuesday. Musk tweeted: \"Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge & see how it goes.\" The meme cryptocurrency skyrocketed after Musk's tweet, soaring as much as 30% early Tuesday. Elon Musk has said Tesla will let people purchase some of its merchandise with the meme cryptocurrency dogecoin . \"Tesla will make some merch buyable with Doge & see how it goes,\" Musk tweeted Tuesday. Dogecoin's price was down before Musk's announcement but then skyrocketed as much as 30%. It was last up 26% at $0.2092, according to crypto data website Coinmarketcap . The Tesla CEO has been a long-running supporter of dogecoin, a Japanese Shiba Inu dog-themed cryptocurrency that was started as a joke in 2013. In May, he asked his Twitter followers whether Tesla should start accepting dogecoin , to which the overwhelming response was \"yes.\" Earlier the same month, Musk said he thought dogecoin could ironically become the future of cryptocurrencies . Tesla wouldn't be the first company to accept the meme token in payment. The Dallas Mavericks  the basketball team owned by crypto fan Mark Cuban  began selling tickets and merchandise in exchange for it earlier this year. Musk and Tesla have been key drivers of the cryptocurrency boom in 2021. The electric-car maker bought $1.5 billion bitcoin in January, and then in March, announced it would start accepting the cryptocurrency in payment for cars. However, Musk rowed back on that idea in May, criticizing bitcoin's \"insane\" energy use. Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies, including dogecoin, are secured and \"mined\" using lots of computing power. Musk began to talk more about dogecoin as he backed away from bitcoin in May, saying he was working with developers to improve its efficiency.

The world's wealthiest man, he was chosen Monday by Time Magazine as its Person of the Year . The publication called Musk \"clown, genius, edgelord, visionary, industrialist, showman, [and] cad.\" Dogecoin's Tuesday jump was out of keeping with the rest of the crypto sector, which was a sea of red. Digital assets are seen by most investors as highly speculative, and have suffered as the Federal Reserve has talked up the chances of tighter monetary policy.

The alert reads as follow in regards to ransomware campaigns: Cybercriminals, including ransomware operators, will continue to exploit the Covid-19 pandemic alongside legitimate efforts to develop, distribute, and administer vaccines. FinCEN is aware of ransomware directly targeting vaccine research, and FinCEN asks financial institutions to stay alert to ransomware targeting vaccine delivery operations as well as the supply chains required to manufacture the vaccines. Within the attacks, the bureau states that phishing schemes are on the rise by placing misinformation about Covid-19 vaccines as bait to catch victims.

Some saw this as an opportunity to rein in these controversial financial products, rather than to let them ride.\nFrom Lara Crigger’s ETF.com report:\n“… (SEC)passed a controversial new rulethat, among other things, would make it significantly easier to launchleveragedandinverseexchange-traded funds, but at smaller multipliers than previously approved. Rule 18f-4 would allow ETFs and other funds that aren't explicitly allowed by the Investment Company Act of 1940 to use derivatives, without first having to obtain exemptive relief. New ETF launches may now apply up to a 200% multiplier, either long or inverse, on their underlying indexes.”\nNew launches of these sorts won’t require SEC blessing on an individual basis to use derivatives for leveraged and inverse exposure, which should ease the approval process. However, the days of new 3X leveraged or inverse ETFs are over, with 2X being the cap going forward, a tip of the hat perhaps to lessening the potential losses these can create.\nDespite also gutting the requirement of presale education to investors who decide to play with this type of fire, I have no problem with allowing these alternative securities to come to market. They require investor caution, but they could also deliver stellar returns in a very short period of time.\nI use this as a backdrop to the ongoing bitcoin ETF saga. It’s been dragging though the seemingly lenient SEC when it comes to risky products like leveraged and inverse ETFs, but it’s been steadfastly opposed to allowing bitcoin in an ETF wrapper.\nAll this got me thinking, what is going on with bitcoin ETFs? Certainly no one has thrown in the towel after all this effort:\nKey Bitcoin ETF Dates:\n* Winklevoss:Filed July 1, 2013; Disapproved March 10, 2017* SolidX (with VanEck later):Filed July 12, 2016; Withdrawn Jan. 23, 2019* Grayscale: Filed July 11, 2017:Withdrawn Oct. 25, 2017* ProShares: Filed Sept. 27, 2017:Disapproved Aug. 22, 2018; Stayed Aug. 23, 2018* Direxion: Filed Dec. 15, 2017:Disapproved Aug. 22, 2018; Stayed Aug. 23, 2018* GraniteShares: Filed Dec. 15, 2017:Disapproved Aug. 22, 2018; Stayed Aug. 23, 2018* Wilshire Phoenix: Filed Jan. 11, 2019:Disapproved Feb. 25, 2020* Bitwise: Filed Jan. 10, 2019:Disapproved Oct. 9, 2019; Stayed Oct. 15, 2019, Withdrawn Jan. 14, 2020\nMore Than 7 Years Ago\nThe early forays into trying to launch a bitcoin ETF were certainly far ahead of the SEC’s curve of understanding—and most people’s understanding—of cryptocurrencies. But along the way, there hasn’t been any obvious progress in the SEC’s willingness to allow bitcoin ETFs.\nWith a market cap currently approaching $200 billion, and hundreds of millions of dollars a day in futures trading, bitcoin has come a long way since that first bitcoin filing in 2013. The SEC, however, not so much.\nSome say the SEC has been growing more comfortable with the idea of a bitcoin ETF, and that one should come sooner rather than later. Matt Hougan, chief investment officer of Bitwise, a digital asset manager that just crossed $100 million in assets under management, is in that camp. He has been on the frontlines of this effort, as his firm tries to launch a bitcoin ETF. I caught up with Hougan to talk about this challenge:\nETF.com: Are there any bitcoin ETFs still alive in the SEC pipeline filing world?\nMatt Hougan:There are no live filings for ETFs for crypto ETFs, and specifically for a bitcoin ETF at this time. There are a number of filings that received disapproval orders from the SEC staff, which were then appealed by commissioners and are currently sort of sitting on appeal. But there's no requirement or expectation for the commissioners to review those and move those along.\nSo the short answer to your question is, no, there are no live filings that I'm aware of at this time. The slightly nuanced answer is, a few filings, but disapproval orders have been sort of appealed and stayed. But they're not, that I know of, making forward progress right now.\nETF.com: Why was there this full-frontal assault on trying to get bitcoin ETFs through the SEC, but then it just completely went away. What’s going on?\nHougan:The reality is there's been sort of two waves of effort around bitcoin ETFs. There was the Winklevosses’ first shot in 2013, and then there were a number of serious follow-on efforts in the 2017/2018 era, whether that's Bitwise or VanEck or Wilshire Phoenix. And those are the ones that received the public disapproval orders.\nWhat the industry saw in those public disapproval orders is that the SEC, rightfully so, is setting a pretty high bar that bitcoin ETFs have to clear on factors like market manipulation and custody audit. So what I’m seeing is that people realize there's a lot of work to be done.\nCertainly that's happening behind the scenes at Bitwise, and I assume what's happening behind the scenes at our competitors, is that people are doing that work. But I think it was just clarity that there was significant work still to be done before you could even take a shot on goal.\nETF.com: How long does it take for the market to prove itself rather than you trying to prove that the market's safe?\nHougan:If we backpedal to like 2013 when the first ETF filings were in, we were far on one side of a wide spectrum spanning from a grassroots, anarchic, unregulated market, to its long-term future as a well-regulated piece of the global financial ecosystem. As an example, there were no regulated insured custodians in the market at that time. Full stop.\nToday you have firms like Fidelity that have insurance from Lloyd's of London that are offering custody for bitcoin under New York State specialized trust charters. You have the New York Stock Exchange setting up a bitcoin custodian that, again, operates under that same regulatory structure and also has insurance in place. You have the Coinbase company which is now an $8 billion company. They also have insurance in place and they're also regulated.\nIn 2013, the market was not prepared to support an ETF that should be available to all investors. There were no well-established trading venues. There was no regulated market at all. There were still a lot of really bad actors. Things have vastly improved.\nPeople like me will argue that we're well along that path, and that the Bitcoin market, as it stands today, is actually a well-functioning market supported by regulated markets like the CME when it comes to futures. But the SEC is fully within its rights to say \"prove it.\" Because it's not like we're coming from a place that's entirely well-established and clean and a well-arbitraged market with clear regulations in place. We're evolving to that space.\nETF.com: There seems to be demand there. How do you quantify that?\nHougan:Bitwise has a full sales team that calls on thousands of advisors a month. And so we hear from them directly. They would like an ETF that allows them to buy and sell bitcoin at net asset value and that fits into their workflow. And they want to do it because there's client demand, and currently those clients are doing it themselves on Coinbase. There are more Coinbase accounts than there are Charles Schwab accounts. So it would be great to bring bitcoin inside that advised setting.\nYou can see there's demand. I hear from people who say, “We don't need a bitcoin ETF.” Their argument is that there are plenty of ways to buy bitcoin today. [On Oct. 21, 2020,] PayPal said it was going to make it possible for people to buy Bitcoin through the PayPal app. That's great, but it doesn't solve the problem for financial advisors who need a regulated product that fits into their workflow. And the only real, robust answer for that is an ETF. I think eventually we'll get there.\nETF.com: What's eventually? A year? Five?\nHougan:I hope it's fewer than five years. I think the best estimate is somewhere between 12 and 36 months out. I know it's a wide window, but people have been cracking on this thing since 2013, and there's still some road to go. I do think it's a matter ofwhenand notif.\nPayPal's a $250 billion company. It has 350 million users, 200 million in the U.S. It's got 26 million merchants who are going to be able to accept crypto. If you have a company of that size that embraces crypto and endorses it and allows it to live in a regulated setting for a huge number of clients, it gets a step further.\nThe Time Has Come\nIt’s hard to knock the SEC for being overly cautious in allowing bitcoin to enter the capital markets as a listed and regulated security. But that many-years grace period and bitcoin’s continued success as a financial product have made the steadfast rejection by regulators seem out of step with change.\nCurrently, bitcoin trades around $13,500, and as the bitcoin price chart below shows, price volatility has cooled considerably. Take away March’s financial market meltdown that impacted all securities, and bitcoin pricing looks relatively rangebound.\n(For a larger view, click on the image above)\nOne reason for that is a futures market in bitcoin that keeps price discovery honest in theory and apparently in practical terms as well.\nTrading volume has also been stable, adding another positive piece to the stability puzzle.\n(For a larger view, click on the image above)\nA report this month by Wilshire Phoenix, a firm that’s also looking for a SEC bitcoin ETF blessing, adds credence to the idea a futures market in bitcoin is legitimizing its status as a trading vehicle every day.\n“The findings of Wilshire Phoenix indicate that CME Bitcoin Futures contribute more to price discovery than its related spot markets,” said an Oct. 14reportfrom Wilshire Phoenix, adding: “A leading futures market suggests the existence of a robust base of traders who may trade on such markets for many reasons such as trust in the exchange venue and low...\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":25720.76,\"take_profit\":29004.11,\"forecast_10d\":[29001.72, 29374.15, 32127.27, 32782.02, 31971.91, 33992.43, 36824.36, 39371.04, 40797.61, 40254.55]}"}

However there’s usually a reason why the price is so low — it may have a sitting tenant, require complete modernisation, be structurally unsound or blighted in some other way. Whether you’re stepping on to the housing ladder or purchasing for investment, always investigate what the problem is, get a survey done and factor in the cost of remedial and renovation work. When applicable, find out if the property is mortgageable as most lenders won’t touch it if it’s in poor condition, very tiny or has under 80 years remaining on the lease. Here’s a round-up of the best budget homes currently for sale in the UK. 1. One-bed house, Bishop Auckland, County Durham. Guide price: £13,500 This boarded-up terraced house in County Durham is on sale for £13,500. Photo: SDL Property Auctions You can probably guess from the boarded-up windows and door that this terraced house is in dire need of a makeover. However, if you were planning to rent it out, the prospect of an annual yield in excess of 30% of the guide price could be all the motivation you need to get started. There’s a living room and kitchen on the ground floor, with the bedroom and bathroom above and a bijou garden at the back. It’s set to be auctioned on 27 January . If it grabs your interest, you’ll need to register by noon the day before and submit your bid remotely. 2. Studio flat, Sheffield. Guide price: £25,000 Residents have use of a laundry and the convenience of a mini supermarket on the ground floor of the building. Photo: Auction House Online (Online property auctions) The city centre location — in walking distance of the train station, shops, university and nightlife — is one of the many plus points of this modern flat, which at the moment is let to a tenant for £563 per calendar month. It comprises a living and sleeping area containing a kitchenette with fitted cupboards and appliances, a built-in wardrobe, desk unit and double bed, and a shower room. Residents have use of a laundry and the convenience of a mini supermarket on the ground floor of the building. As it’s for sale via online auction , it could well achieve more than the guide price of £25,000. Bidding opens at 1pm on 24 January and closes 24 hours later, and you must register in advance.

Price: £80,000 There are only 64 years left on the lease for this property so obtaining a mortgage would be unlikely. Photo: Your Move (estate agent) This is probably the cheapest non-retirement property on the market in Greater London where, according to Zoopla, flats have changed hands for average of £521,000 over the past year. Its low price is due to the fact that it’s compact with only 64 years left on the lease, so is available to cash buyers only as there’s little likelihood of obtaining a mortgage. The property has all-white walls and a Shaker style kitchen. Photo: Your Move (Your Move) Once you’ve overcome that obstacle, it’s chain free and ready to move into. The ground floor flat has its own front door and consists of a lounge/bedroom area with a wide archway through into a Shaker-style kitchen, a shower room, separate WC and garden.

Others like independent market analyst ‘Rekt Capital’ are not so quick to jump the gun and declare that all is lost. \\nAs shown in the following chart posted by Rekt Capital, “the recent BTC rejection means that BTC is now residing at the lower region of its current $38,000-$43,100 range.”\\nBTC/USD 1-week chart. Source: Twitter.According to Rekt Capital, “Bitcoin is just consolidating inside the $38,000-$43,100 range,” but needs to hold this support level to avoid dropping down into a lower consolidation range. \\nRekt Capital said,\\n“Technically, the $38,000 support area is what separates BTC from entering the $28,000-$38,000 consolidation range. Bitcoin last consolidated in said range in Q1 and Q2 of 2021.”\\nHead and shoulders pattern confirmed\\nAnalysis of the BTC price action from a purely technical point of view was touched on by David Lifchitz, managing partner and chief investment officer at ExoAlpha, who pointed out that the “giant head and shoulders pattern for BTC is now completed with the neckline broken with BTC at $38,300.” \\nBTC/USDT 1-day chart. Source: TradingViewFrom a theoretical standpoint, Lifchitz noted that this pattern predicts a possible drawdown as low as $20,000, but he stated that the “fall has generally been less than that” and suggested that “the $31,000 region could definitely be in sight.” \\nFrom a fundamental point of view, Lifchitz noted multiple factors that have been creating headwinds for BTC, including tightening from the United States Federal Reserve, chatter from the European Union regulators looking to ban proof-of-work (PoW) mining, profit-taking from late 2021 and the continued uncertainty about the economic future as it relates to the Covid pandemic. \\nLifchitz said, \\n“Therefore for Bitcoin, a move down to the low-mid $30,000 could be definitely in the cards soon before real dip-buyers show up.”\\nTraders look to scoop up BTC at $30,000\\nA look at how traders have responded to this drawdown as compared to the pullback in June of 2021 was provided by analyst and Cointelegraph contributor Michaël van de Poppe, who posted the following chart highlighting the major support zones for each period of weakness. \\nBTC/USD 1-day chart.

The business intelligence firm has been\\xa0reporting\\xa0that it used these methods of calculating figures for its BTC buys, excluding the “impact of share-based compensation expense and impairment losses and gains on sale from intangible assets.” Essentially, this negates some of the effects of the volatility of the crypto market.GAAP rules are seemingly not designed for reporting the value of cryptocurrencies. However, MicroStrategy has purchased 124,391 BTC as of Dec. 30, representing more than $4.7 billion in value across several buys totaling roughly $3.8 billion since August 2020. The company reported it used non-GAAP practices to exclude “cumulative impairment losses” from the cost, basing the value of its holdings on the market price of 1 BTC at 4:00 pm EST on the last day of each period.MicroStrategy said, following a BTC purchase in July 2021, that it “believes that these non-GAAP financial measures are also useful to investors and analysts in comparing its performance across reporting periods on a consistent basis.” The SEC reportedly said MicroStrategy should “remove this adjustment in future filings.”The report came as shares of MicroStrategy fell more than 17.8% in the last 24 hours to reach a six-month low price of $375. The drop may have been affected by BTC also falling to a six-month low as the crypto asset dipped under $38,000.

Preventing the Proliferation of Risks Associated With Cryptos A Botswana government draft document that proposes to regulate new and developing virtual assets businesses, as well as to provide a regulatory body with its functions and powers, is now set to be presented before the country’s lawmakers, a recent government gazette has shown. The planned presentation of the Virtual Asset Bill alongside other bills such as the Financial Intelligence Bill comes just over two months after the country’s central bank warned residents engaged in cryptocurrency trading that Botswana does not have a regulatory framework to govern such trading. Yet, in the draft that was published in the Extraordinary Government Gazette on December 23, Botswana authorities suggest they are not only seeking to recognize crypto trade but plan to include &#8220;provisions for managing, mitigating and preventing money laundering and financing of terrorism&#8221; into the proposed law. The draft also seeks to prevent the proliferation risks that are associated with virtual assets and new emerging business practices and technologies. Concerning companies or entities that issue tokens, the draft bill states: Part III further provides that the Regulatory Authority may grant a licence if the applicant demonstrates that it has the necessary infrastructure and resources to carry out the business activities of a virtual asset service provider or issuer of initial token offerings and that the applicant is a fit and proper person. The definition of “fit and proper” is provided for in clause 11 (2) consistently with the provisions of the Financial Intelligence Act. Elsewhere, the draft explains the instances where the regulator can grant an operating license to applicants. For their part, license holders are expected to protect assets belonging to clients. They are also expected to &#8220;prevent market abuse and provide measures for the acquisition of a beneficial interest in their businesses.&#8221; if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); White Paper Issuance Mandatory With respect to the advertisement of token offerings, the draft states: &#8220;Part IV further provides that a licence holder shall issue a white paper that contains full and accurate information for potential purchasers of virtual assets and initial token offerings to make informed decisions.&#8221; Meanwhile, some crypto enthusiasts have speculated that Botswana’s proposal to amend its financial laws could be linked to the country&#8217;s removal from the Financial Action Task Force&#8217;s (FATF) graylisted countries in October 2021. The FATF had previously cited deficiencies in the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) and counter-terrorist financing (CTF) regimes as reasons for flagging the country. However, in late 2021 — nearly three years after grey-listing — the FATF said it had removed Botswana from the list after noting some improvement. What are your thoughts on this story?

Because unlike Bitcoin, there is no CEO or HQ they can raid and there is no one man that can press a button and shut it down.

Grayscale Investments third annual report on attitudes and perspectives about Bitcoin shows that demand for Bitcoin recorded a tremendous jump in 2021. A survey conducted in mid-August showed that, among 1,000 people quizzed, the percentage of people holding Bitcoin in the US rose to 26%. The report, dubbed Grayscale 2021 Bitcoin Investor Study, was made in partnership with financial market research firm 8 Acre Perspective, and it demonstrates continued growth in interest, awareness, and adoption of Bitcoin and the digital currency ecosystem at large. More than half (59%) omostly invested through crypto trading apps like eToro or Coinbase, representing a paradigm shift from last year when more than three-quarters of investors (77%) preferred a Bitcoin exchange. Investors are eager to buy  a sentiment reflected by the recent all-time high in November 2021, placing Bitcoin closer to $100,000 than it is to zero. The Grayscale study also showed that most of these investors were hodling, with approximately 66% of those who purchased Bitcoin more than 12 months ago still owning it today. Of the investors who have sold, 91% have sold at least some Bitcoin at a profit. Need for Bitcoin ETF Even with the rise of market segments and use cases, such as decentralised finance (DeFi) and non-fungible tokens (NFTs), Bitcoin still accounts for 46% of the total value of crypto markets. Grayscale revealed that more than three-quarters (77%) of US investors said they would be more likely to invest in Bitcoin if an ETF existed. In October 2021, the concept of a Bitcoin ETF was realised as the Bitcoin futures ETF sponsored by ProShares made its trading debut on the New York Stock Exchange. The demographics of Bitcoin investors also shifted in 2021. Bitcoin is increasingly crossing generations to reach older investors, including retirees who are keen to consider Bitcoin investment products as a component of their portfolios.

First in a series produced by Forkast.News with support from the Judith Neilson Institutes Asian Stories project. There is no stage bigger than the Olympics, for the athletes and the host country. Modern China announced its arrival 13 years ago when 2,008 synchronized drummers performed at the Beijing Summer Olympics opening ceremonies. In February, China is expected to use the Beijing Winter Olympics to unveil a creation of intense international interest: the digital yuan, the first major central bank digital currency, or CBDC. Consumers are unlikely to notice much difference shopping with e-CNY, as the currency is officially known. It will be worth the same as cash and will activate with a tap, swipe or QR code. But the questions this form of money raises are profound. As governments around the world move to phase out physical cash, what will become of financial privacy? How will state-sponsored digital money affect Chinas economy, its trading relationships and  most weighty of all  the future of the global financial system now dominated by the United States and the dollar? Related: Huobi Reveals Countries Where It Has Halted Derivatives Trading The question is not whether Chinas CBDC will upend the current rules of global trade and commerce, said Pauline Loong, director of Hong Kong-based research consultancy Asia-analytica. The only question is how far-reaching the ramifications will be across issues related to who controls access to capital and its movements. But for all of the digital yuans consequence, it is a toe peeking out from a giant red curtain. Behind is an ambitious and largely invisible infrastructure program to rewire the country and its economy with a distributed ledger technology known as blockchain. China has moved deliberately to secure first-mover advantage in what it believes is the future of the internet. Story continues If the digital yuan is Beijings tender for the digital frontier, its blockchain initiative is its bid to build the railroads. A new money The story of how China came to settle the technological frontier begins with the 2008 financial crisis. Just one month after the Summer Olympics, an underregulated U.S. financial sector tripped the world into recession. It was a vulnerability that China decided it was no longer willing to accept. As the crisis was unfolding, then-President Hu Jintao called upon like-minded nations at the G20 summit to steadily promote the diversification of the international monetary system. Related: Is China Opting Out of Crypto? Feat. Dovey Wan Receiving a muted response, China forged ahead in creating parallel institutions to those dominated by the U.S. In 2010, when Washingtons sanctions effectively locked Iran out of the international financial system, Chinas focus on cross-border currency flows intensified. By then, domestic concerns were spurring creative thinking around monetary policy. One was how to get 400 million underbanked Chinese out of poverty. E-commerce giant Alibaba introduced a mobile payment system in 2008, taking advantage of the countrys high rates of smartphone adoption: By 2015, 800 million Chinese would be using smartphones, according to the Pew Research Center. But such private payment systems left the Bank of China on the sidelines and did little for rising Communist Party leader Xi Jinpings anti-corruption strategy, which required closer state monitoring of money. Then, around 2012, regulators began to observe strange patterns in power grids across the country. From Xinjiang to Inner Mongolia, huge amounts of electricity were surging into warehouses packed with powerful computers and colossal servers. The processors were crunching numbers to produce  or mine  a new kind of money called bi te bi in Mandarin.  At their peak in the late-2010s, Chinese miners are thought to have produced 95% of the worlds bi te bi , or bitcoin . This money had no connection to a bank or any centralized authority at all. It was entirely digital and uniquely secure. Every transaction was broadcast to every computer within a network for confirmation and recorded permanently in a long series of distributed ledger entries, or blocks. Chinese officials grasped the implications of this unregulated activity immediately. In 2014, its Peoples Bank of China (PBOC) began studying the possibility of a government version of Bitcoin. With each passing year, the disappearance of paper yuan from the economy made the idea more plausible. By 2019, PwC reported, 96% of Chinese regularly shopped online. Before many governments even knew the basics of Bitcoin, Chinese authorities started to take leadership in the security of the network on the mining side, said Ian Wittkopp, vice president at Beijing-based Sino Global Capital. This led to the development of a strong blockchain and crypto ecosystem. By October 2020, the digital yuan was ready for pilot testing among Chinas masses. All told, 750,000 people chosen by lottery were given 150 million e-CNY (US$23 million) to spend at roughly 70,000 bricks-and-mortar businesses plus a slew of online retailers. Six months later, new trials allowed open participation. This marked the first monitored release of the digital yuan into the wild. By June, nursing homes in Chengdu were teaching elderly residents how to use the new money. Such care and expense are necessary to ensure the Olympics debut is as well-rehearsed as those 2,008 drummers, according to Peter Cai, who studies Chinas economy and trade policy at the Lowy Institute in Sydney. The cost of getting something wrong on this is tremendous, he said. Chinese officials are right to talk about the digital currency as if its a new frontier. What are the full implications for financial, banking and payment systems, or the conduct of a monetary policy? I dont think anybody has a firm grip on that. And that includes China. The next internet During two decades of historic economic growth, China has had a mixed record on high technologies. It has struggled to attain self-sufficiency  never mind dominance  in the production of semiconductors and chips. It was ahead of the curve on 5G broadband but lags behind the West in fields of arguably greater strategic value, such as artificial intelligence. When it comes to blockchain, China appears to have taken a lead in a technology of consequence. After President Xi in 2019 promised blockchain would lead the next wave of the digital transformation of China, thousands of companies reportedly initiated blockchain projects related to everything from retail banking to global shipping and supply chains. This profusion of activity continues apace. Said Wittkopp, Its a field of one. No other country is even close. These projects are transforming a digital ecosystem that was already among the worlds most sophisticated, according to a recent McKinsey study. China has 850 million internet users and more than a quarter of the worlds most successful startups. One of them is Hangzhou-based Ant Group. The financial services giant has over 50 blockchain-based decentralized apps, or dapps, in areas such as shipping, insurance claim processing and charitable donations. Internet search firm Baidu, the Google of China, has 20 dapps, including one that has handled 35 million pieces of electronic evidence for Chinas Internet Court. Its not just tech companies staking territory on the blockchain frontier. A division of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China has developed dapps for retail and corporate use. Insurance giant Ping An uses them to finance public-works projects. A dapp used by the China Construction Bank has helped local banks facilitate $134 billion in loans. Blockchain will make our tech and our society work better, said Yifan He , blockchain evangelist and CEO of engineering firm Red Date Technology. It can make all the IT systems in the world communicate like they are in one room. He predicts in 10 years all transactions that require more than two parties will be blockchain-based. The state of blockchain today is like the internet of 1993, He said. Back then, most companies could not afford the entry costs of the nascent internet (which began as a public infrastructure project overseen by the U.S. Defense Department). In April 2020, China formalized its bet on blockchain by creating the Blockchain-based Service Network, or BSN, managed by Red Date. It is an infrastructure platform that allows private entities, especially small and medium-sized businesses, to overcome the two biggest barriers to entry  interoperability and prohibitive costs. We built everything for you already; you just connect to it and work on your smart contract, said He, who claims the development cost of a simple dapp within the BSN could be as little as 1% of commercial blockchain. By its first anniversary in April 2021 the BSN had attracted 20,000 users and more than 2,500 projects across 120 nodes throughout China plus Johannesburg, Northern California, Paris, São Paulo, Singapore, Sydney and Tokyo. S-Labs, a Beijing startup, has used it to develop applications that have helped over 5,000 SMEs find more than 500 million yuan in loans during the pandemic. S-Labs Chief Technology Officer Li Ming said the BSN is easy to use because it meets Chinese government standards and helps them find customers. The biggest convenience of BSN is its brand effect. And if He has his way, todays youth will be the first blockchain-native generation. This fluency is already being developed in high schools where the BSN is exploring how to teach students, including by holding programming contests with cash prizes. Blockchain should be a basic skill, said He. The idea is to help more people become comfortable using the technology. In June, Red Date closed on US$30 million in Series A funding that was notable for its global reach.

They added that any financial institution based in Mexico is “not authorized to carry out and offer to the public operations with virtual assets,” specifically mentioning Bitcoin (BTC), Ether (ETH), and XRP. The country’s financial regulators and central bank seemed to be targeting Ricardo Salinas Pliego regarding his recent Bitcoin announcement. The third richest person in Mexico said on Sunday that he was exploring the possibility his bank, Banco Azteca, would accept Bitcoin in an apparent effort to promote widespread adoption. However, finance minister Arturo Herrera said financial systems in Mexico are prohibited from using cryptocurrencies, a policy that was unlikely to change in the near future. The authorities added that they would follow the evolution of cryptocurrency as well as the potential uses of its underlying technology, but still referred to digital assets as volatile, speculative, and a less effective medium of exchange than fiat. While Mexico is taking a seemingly strong anti-crypto stance, its neighbors have done the opposite by promoting crypto as a valid currency and encouraging businesses to accept Bitcoin.

It&#x2019;s more of a currency. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Last week, Cramer revealed that he sold almost all of his bitcoin because he was worried about China cracking down on cryptocurrency and bitcoin mining as well as BTC&#x2019;s role in ransomware attacks. The Mad Money host was previously bullish about bitcoin, advising people to put 5% of their portfolios in the cryptocurrency because he said gold let him down.

It will also be more accommodating than China&#x2019;s authoritarian approach to crypto regulation. US Regulation Would &#x2018;Ultimately Be Very Positive&#x2019; for Mass Adoption of Bitcoin, Cryptocurrencies Christopher Wood, Head of Global Equity Strategy at Jefferies, discussed cryptocurrency regulation in his most recent weekly research note, Greed & Fear. Jefferies is a diversified financial services company engaged in investment banking and capital markets, asset management, and direct investing. The company claims to be &#x201C;the largest independent, global, full-service investment banking firm headquartered in the U.S.,&#x201D; according to its website. Wood reportedly said that the regulatory response to cryptocurrency in the U.S. will likely be more accommodating than &#x201C;China&#x2019;s authoritarian model&#x201D; given the fast deteriorating state of the U.S.-China relations. He expects the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) to come up with a definitive regulatory roadmap, citing the new SEC chairman, Gary Gensler, who is pushing for a regulatory framework on cryptocurrencies. Gensler has repeatedly said that crypto exchanges need more regulation, asking Congress to weigh in. Wood opined: That would ultimately be very positive since bitcoin or other crypto assets can only really fulfill their network potential, in terms of mass adoption, if they become part of the system. Recently, China has been cracking down on bitcoin mining and the People&#x2019;s Bank of China (PBOC) has reminded banks in the country that they are proh...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): [['u/meious', 'I have seen an abundant amount of posts from ShibArmy soldiers asking what something is, how it works and to dumb-it-down for them. Have no fear, I will explain in simple terms and cover things like leash, Shiba and bone and their importance to Shibaswap.', 1806, '2021-06-28 00:19', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBArmy/comments/o970bt/i_have_seen_an_abundant_amount_of_posts_from/', 'ShibaSwap: is a place where people can swap ECR20 tokens.  Shiba, Leash, Bone are all tokens.  So are Tether, Wrapped Bitcoin and Binance to name a few.  Tokens are not coins, coins are Ethereum, Bitcoin and Litecoin to name a few.\\n\\nWhy is this important?  Shibaswap is a place for people to trade (swap) their ERC-20 Tokens.  So you will be able (or anyone in the world) to swap Ethereum for Wrapped Bitcoin or USDC for any ERC-20 token (these are just examples, there will be many other options for people to choose from).\\n\\nSimply put, it is a trading system.\\n\\nHow does Staking work in Shibaswap and which one is the best?  There are three options to choose from and each one offers different benefits.  It is up to you to decide which one works best with what you are trying to accomplish (your long term goals).  \\n\\nTHIS IS IMPORTANT, SO READ IT TWICE AND LET IT SINK IN\\n\\nStaking Shiba (Bury):  When you stake Shiba Tokens, you will get three rewards for doing so.  The first reward you get is Bone (3% to the staking pool) which is a ERC-20 Token.  Getting bone is nice and I will explain the reason why further down, BUT, You get Bone for just about everything you do on the site.\\n\\nThe second reward is Ethereum.  This is a very important reward because when you stake Shib AND ONLY Shib, you get a % of ALL…..ALL…..ALL…..ALL!!!!!!!!!!! Of the Ethereum transaction fees (gas) that occurs on the ENTIRE Shibaswap site.  Why is that so important?  EVERYTHING on Shibaswap requires a Ethereum gas fee!  Everything!  Let that sink in….\\n\\nThe third reward is you also get .05% of all other transactions that occurs on the Shibaswap site that don’t include ETH, WBTC, DIA, USDT and USDC.  Which means if John swaps Binance token with Jane for her Doge token on the Shibaswap site, you will get a % of that transaction as a reward in Shiba token.  This is important because this allows you to increase the size of your Shiba token share, which in turn (if you re-stake it) will increase your % of rewards you get back.\\n\\nStaking Leash (Bury):  When you stake Leash Tokens, you get two rewards for doing so.  The first is Bone (1% to the staking pool), as stated above, it is nice to get, but you will get it as a reward for just about everything you do on the site.\\n\\nThe second reward (and the most important in my opinion) is you get .05% of all swap fees that don’t include ETH, WBTC, DAI, USDT and USDC (same example as with the Shib) but it gets returned to you in the form of Leash.  Why is this important?  Leash is the smallest issued token on the Shibaswap network.  Which means that the value of it will be and remain way down the road, the most valuable token you can earn through staking since there is a limited supply.  Staking Leash is the only way to EARN leash (or you can buy it out-right).\\n\\nStaking Bone (bury):  When you stake Bone Tokens, you get two rewards for doing so.  The first is Bone of course! The second is also Bone!  You will get rewarded with Bone each time a new Bone is minted and a % (0.05) of all swap transactions that happen on the site excluding ETH, WBTC, DAI, USDT and USDC.  Why is bone important?  There are (as of this moment, this may change down the road) two reasons why Bone is important.  First, you have to own Bone to be able to vote on future changes to the Shibaswap Site.  The more you own, the bigger your input is valued!  The second reason is because you need it to participate in the liquidity pool (which has its own rewards).\\n\\nWith me so far?  So which one is the best to do?  The answer is all of them!  Each one offers a different benefit, Staking Shiba gets you ETH (which a very valuable coin).  Staking Leash, gets you more Leash, which is in short supply (and is at the time of writing this, worth more than ETH).  Staking Bone gets you more Bone, which you will need to vote with and to provide in liquidity pools (see the benefits of liquidity pools below).  Now….lets move on to Liquidity pools (Digging).\\n\\nWhat are Liquidity pools?  Liquidity pools are used to process the transactions (swaps) between two Tokens.  For example, John wants to trade (swap) his Ethereum coins for Shiba.  He would then go to that option in Shibaswap (Shib-ETH pool) and trade (swap) those tokens.  But, WHO is he trading (swapping) with?  The answer is no one.  There isn’t another person waiting in the winds with their Shiba to trade him.  Instead, you (the liquidity provider) give him the Shiba Tokens he wanted and take his ETH (or rather, the POOL does) and you are part of that pool.  In the liquidity pool, you provide both ETH and Shib to be used in these transactions.\\n\\nShiba Liquidity Pools (DIG):  When you put your Shiba Tokens into the ETH-SHIBA liquidity pool you will earn one reward.  It is in the form of a special token called an SSLP (ShibaSwapLiquidityPool).  You can use that SSLP token to deposit into (Woof) another staking program which rewards you with Bone.  The amount of SSLP tokens you receive is based on how much liquidity you provide to the pool.  It is not a passive reward, which means you only get it each time you deposit more of your SHIB/ETH into the pool (this goes the same for Leash and Bone pools).\\n\\nLeash Liquidity Pools (DIG):  Putting your Leash Tokens into the LEASH-ETH pool with earn you three rewards (remember early I stated that earning Leash was important) The first reward is SSLP tokens.  \\n\\n(IMPORTANT) The second reward the pool gets .1% of all WBTC swap transactions that occur on the Shibaswap site.  \\n\\nThe third (also important) reward is .1% of all USDC transactions that happen on the Shibaswap site.  \\n\\nWhy are these important?  Because WBTC is Wrapped Bitcoin which has a value that matches Bitcoin!  So if Bitcoin is at $30,000.00 per coin, then WBTC is also valued at 30K, and you, as a pool member, will get a % of that transaction returned to you in Wrapped bitcoin.  USDC is also important because it is one of the most commonly used tokens that people trade with (the more common of a transaction, the more rewards). Why is it common?  Most people who buy and sell crypto on a regular basis (non-Hodlers) will buy a coin/token when it dips, then sell it (swap it) for a stable coin (USDC) when that token hits his/her target selling price.  Then they rinse and repeat this action over and over again.  Every time they do this, the pool (you are part of this pool) gets a piece of the cake!\\n\\nBone Liquidity Pools (DIG):  Putting your Bones to work in a BONE-ETH pool earns you three rewards.  You will get SSLP token as your first reward.\\n\\nThe second and third rewards are .1% of all DAI and .1% of all USDT swap transactions that occur on the Shibaswap site are given to the pool members as a reward.  DAI and USDT are both stable coins.  These two tokens are very popular with (non-Hodlers) when they swap the dips and highs (just like the Leash example).\\n\\nWhy is there a bonus for people who put their ETH/SHIB, ETH/LEASH and ETH/BONE into the liquidity pools during the first two weeks of the Shibaswap launch and why is it important?\\n\\nThe swap can’t function at all of there is no liquidity (Shib, Leash, Bone and Ethereum) for people to actively swap with-in the pools.  When you stake (Bury) your crypto, you are only mining (for a simpler term) the new blocks being made.  You aren’t helping the SWAP part of Shibaswap.  When you put your tokens into the pools, you are actually making the SWAP part of Shibaswap possible.  \\n\\nWhich is better to do?  They all have equal importance.  It is up for you to decide which one(s) help you get to your long time goals and which rewards you value most.  You can do all 6, just one or mix and match what you like.  There is no wrong or right way.  \\n\\nI hope this helps some of you make it to the Moon!', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBArmy/comments/o970bt/i_have_seen_an_abundant_amount_of_posts_from/', 'o970bt', [['u/dogbuyer', 140, '2021-06-28 00:25', 'https://www.reddit.com/r/SHIBArmy/comments/o970bt/i_have_seen_an_abundant_amount_of_posts_from/h39bme3/', 'Read this multiple times folks.

At the time of writing, Bitcoin , BTC to USD, was down by 0.90% to $33,388.1. A mixed start to the day saw Bitcoin rise to an early morning current day high $33,869.0 before hitting reverse. Falling well short of the first major resistance level at $35,049, Bitcoin slid to a mid-morning current day low $32,343.0. Steering clear of the first major support level at $32,061, Bitcoin moved back through to $33,000 levels to limit the morning losses. The Rest of the Pack Its been a mixed morning for the broader crypto market. Ethereum bucked the trend early on, falling by 1.03% to join Bitcoin in the red. Its been a bullish morning for the rest of the majors, however. Bitcoin Cash SV and Cardanos ADA led the way through the morning, with gains of 6.08% and 6.96% respectively. Binance Coin (+2.72%), Crypto.com Coin (+3.22%), Litecoin (+2.34%), and Ripples XRP (+1.94%) also found relatively strong support. Chainlink (+0.97%) and Polkadot (+0.20%) trailed the front runners, however. Through the early hours, the crypto total market rose to an early morning high $1,346bn before falling to a low $1,286bn. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $1,334bn. Bitcoins dominance rose to an early high 47.20% before falling to a low 46.74%. At the time of writing, Bitcoins dominance stood at 46.86%. For the Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move back through the $33,420 pivot to support a run at the first major resistance level at $35,049. Support from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break back through to $34,000 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level would likely cap any upside. In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at $37,000 levels. The second major resistance level sits at $36,408. Failure to move back through the $33,420 pivot would bring the first major support level at $32,061 back into play. Story continues Barring crypto meltdown through the afternoon, however, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$30,000 support levels. The second major support level at $30,432 should limit the downside. Looking beyond the support and resistance levels, the 50 EMA has failed to narrow on the 100 and the 200 through the morning, supporting the morning pullback. We have also seen the 100 EMA flat on the 200 EMA adding further downward pressure. A narrowing of the 50 EMA on the 100 EMA, however, would bring $35,000 levels into play. Key going into the afternoon will be a move through Wednesdays high $34,778 to give the bulls a run at $37,000 levels.

All rights reserved || By Kevin Buckland TOKYO, Jan 24 (Reuters) - The dollar hovered near a six-week high against major peers on Wednesday as investors cemented expectations that the Federal Reserve would be in no rush to cut interest rates in the face of a resilient U.S. economy. The Japanese yen, though, ticked higher as expectations rose for a stimulus exit as soon as March, following hawkish comments from the Bank of Japan on Tuesday. The U.S. dollar index - which tracks the currency against six rivals, including the euro and yen - was flat at 103.48 after rising to the highest since Dec. 13 at 103.82 in the previous session. The U.S. rate futures market on Tuesday priced in a roughly 47% chance of a March rate cut, up from late on Monday, but down from as much 80% about two weeks ago, according to LSEG's rate probability app. For 2024, futures traders are betting on five quarter-point rate cuts. Two weeks ago they expected six. In the last comments before Fed officials entered a blackout period ahead of their Jan. 31 policy decision, San Francisco Fed President Mary Daly said Friday she believes monetary policy is in a \"good place\" and it is premature to think rate cuts are imminent. Earlier that week, Fed Governor Christopher Waller said policymakers would move \"carefully and slowly\", which traders took as pushing back at pricing for a speedy fall in rates. \"Markets have been correcting from the narrative that rate cuts were incoming and incoming quickly,\" leading to dollar strength, said James Kniveton, senior corporate FX dealer at Convera. \"This follows a general pattern of resistance to inflation reduction the closer central banks get to their final target, and has caused a rethinking of how fast monetary policy would return to lower levels,\" he added. \"We have seen ECB (European Central Bank) officials push back on rate cut expectations as well, in line with the Federal Reserve.\" The ECB decides policy on Thursday. No change in interest rates is expected, but investors will watch the tone of the statement and central bank chief Christine Lagarde's press conference for clues on where rates are headed. Story continues The euro was flat at $1.08565, after slipping as low as $1.0822 on Tuesday for the first time since Dec. 13. Sterling was slightly higher at $1.2694, making up some ground following an overnight dip of 0.2%. The Bank of England announces its policy decision on Feb. 1. The Japanese yen gained some ground on Wednesday, following a volatile session a day earlier, after the BOJ opted to keep stimulus settings unchanged, as expected, but central bank head Kazuo Ueda hinted at a possible end to negative rates in April or even March. The dollar declined 0.17% to 148.085 yen, after swinging from as low as 146.99 and as high as 148.70 on Tuesday. The Bank of Canada meets on policy on Wednesday, and is expected to leave its key overnight rate unchanged at a 22-year high of 5%. The greenback was flat at C$1.3462, after slipping 0.15% on Tuesday. China's yuan was steady in offshore trading at 7.1660 per dollar, keeping close to a nearly two week high of 7.1635 from Tuesday, when Bloomberg reported that Chinese policymakers are seeking to mobilise about 2 trillion yuan ($278.86 billion) as part of a stabilisation fund to support the ailing stock market.

Most Read from Bloomberg SEC’s X Account Hacked to Falsely Say Bitcoin ETF Approved Amazon’s Twitch to Cut 500 Employees, About 35% of Staff Bottled Water Contains More Plastic Particles Than Previously Thought Boeing CEO Fights Back Tears and Admits ‘Our Mistake’ in 737 Address Spurred by government and institutional pressure at companies to improve corporate governance and boost valuations, activist investors are pursuing more difficult and high-profile investments. Shareholder proposals, which also hit a peak last year, will probably reach a record when annual meetings roll around this summer. “We are only at the beginning of a period of more pronounced activity,” said Peter Guenthardt, head of Asia-Pacific investment banking at Bank of America Corp. Activist investors “are back with a vengeance now, and the reason for that is because they do see the value and believe this time around the circumstances are very different.” The total market value of Japanese companies targeted by activists more than doubled to $252 billion in 2023, from $117 billion the prior year, according to data compiled by Bloomberg. The majority of campaigns so far focus on boosting shareholder returns, such as getting small- to mid-cap businesses to issue more dividends. As they gain a stronger foothold, these investors are becoming more emboldened, and will probably pursue tougher strategies and tackle larger, more conservative companies. Here are some of the campaigns to watch this year: Palliser Capital — Keisei Railway London-based Palliser Capital disclosed in October it had built a 1.6% stake in Keisei Electric Railway Co. and had been speaking with management for more than two years. Railroad and transport companies have long been seen as difficult targets because of their conservative culture, and analysts have said the outcome of Palliser’s campaign could be a litmus test of whether activist investors can succeed with larger, tougher-to-crack businesses. “If Palliser had tried to do this five years ago, my guess is they’d have gotten absolutely nowhere,” said CLSA broker John Seagrim. “Where before Keisei would’ve basically ignored Palliser, it can’t anymore.” Palliser’s proposals to Keisei include selling off part of its 22% ownership stake in Tokyo Disneyland operator Oriental Land Co. to a level where its market value can be recognized on the balance sheet, and re-investing the capital into the railway’s operations and business. Story continues Keisei currently has no need to raise funds, a representative for the railway operator said, adding that it might eventually sell its stake, but not immediately. Palliser said it was confident in unlocking value at Keisei and that it will continue to work with management. 3D Investment Partners — Fuji Soft, Sapporo The secretive Japanese-run hedge fund based in Singapore became well-known as a Toshiba Corp. investor during the troubled conglomerate’s privatization saga last year. Now, 3D’s most public investments are two very different businesses — software company Fuji Soft Inc. and beermaker Sapporo Holdings Ltd. — with a similar issue: large non-core real estate holdings that can be sold off to free up money for other uses. Although 3D’s stakes were made public in 2022, it made significant progress on the campaigns last year, which will continue to play out in 2024. Sapporo in September established a committee to review options for its property business, while Fuji Soft said in November it was looking to shrink its real estate footprint. “One of the more interesting things in 2024 will be more focus on hidden land assets,” Seagrim said. “3D has led the way on that with Fuji Soft and Sapporo.” A Sapporo representative said the company was working to increase corporate value for shareholders. Fuji Soft and 3D didn’t respond to requests for comment. ValueAct Capital — Recruit ValueAct Capital’s campaign around Recruit Holdings Co., the company behind the world’s largest employment portal, is still in its early days but already has the drama of two well-known players. Recruit, a $69 billion company, has a global business through its ownership of Indeed.com and Glassdoor. San Francisco-based ValueAct has made a name for itself in Japan with a very public campaign at convenience store operator Seven & i Holdings Co., where it has continued to call for a strategic review after losing a fight to oust the chief executive. Although details now are thin over its Recruit investment, ValueAct said in November it had taken about a 1.1% stake and thinks the company is worth twice as much as what it had been trading at. A representative for ValueAct did not respond to a request for comment. Recruit reiterated its prior comment, saying that the investment “is a recognition of the value and long-term potential of our company,” adding, “We look forward to having ValueAct as a shareholder and continued engagement.” “We’ll see more and more activists coming to Japan who want to tackle companies with big market valuations,” said Tsuyoshi Maruki, founder of Tokyo-based activist fund Strategic Capital Inc., speaking generally about recent trends. Asset Value Investors — Nihon Kohden London-based AVI took a stake in medical devices maker Nihon Kohden Corp. in late 2022, saying it had productive talks with the company and believed it could grow profits 14% annually, on average, over the next five years and boost its business overseas. This year could be pivotal for the investment, as Nihon Kohden is set to announce a new mid-term management plan in May that will test whether AVI’s engagement has paid off or spur it to step up its campaign. Adding to the plot is the disclosure last month that ValueAct, which had a successful campaign shaking up the board and business at medical products maker Olympus Corp., had also taken a stake in Nihon Kohden. “We might have to explore whether to be more proactive if the mid-term plan disappoints,” said Daniel Lee, head of Japan research at AVI. A Nihon Kohden representative declined to comment about specific shareholders. Ariake Capital — Chiba Kogyo Bank Ariake Capital is relatively new to the activism scene in Japan. Founded by Goldman Sachs Group Inc. alumni and based in Tokyo, the investment fund is solely focused on unlocking value at Japan’s numerous regional banks — notorious for being inefficient with little prospects for growth, following years under the Bank of Japan’s negative interest-rate policy. Pressure from the Tokyo Stock Exchange to boost price-to-book ratios and the possibility of a change in the BOJ’s monetary policy have increased investor interest in bank stocks, Ariake’s Chief Investment Officer Katsunori Tanaka said in an email, adding that the company has been friendly in its engagement with regional banks. “We intend to be proactive in making additional investments this year.” One of Ariake’s recent stakes has focused on Chiba Kogyo Bank Ltd., asking the bank to improve employee incentives and revamp certain loan business segments. In November, Chiba Kogyo said it would review its mortgage operation, which Tanaka said was “just the first step” in a tweet. A Chiba Kogyo spokesperson said the bank was building a relationship with Ariake, and did not consider the fund to be an activist investor. Nippon Active Value Fund — Fuji Media Nippon Active Value Fund and Dalton Investments, both overseen by investor Jamie Rosenwald, disclosed a joint 5% stake in broadcast company Fuji Media Holdings Inc. in December and said it may make proposals to the broadcaster in the future. Japanese broadcasters make interesting but complex targets because they sit on assets like content intellectual property and large real estate holdings, and are subject to a law that prevents foreign investors from owning more than 20%. Fuji Media shares trade at around 0.4 times the book value of its assets. Rosenwald declined to give more details on the investment. Fuji Media declined to comment on dialogue with specific investors. --With assistance from Hideyuki Sano, Adam Kommel and Takahiko Hyuga. (Updates with comment from Palliser Capital.)

Bidding for both safe-haven currencies persisted amid tensions between Iran and the United States.\n\"Our expectation is that there will be some sort of trade truce or some goodwill signs coming out of the G20 meetings\" between Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping, said David Kelly, chief global strategist at JPMorgan Funds.\n\"But neither side is ready to end the war,\" Kelly said, predicting trade tensions would linger until the U.S. presidential election in November 2020.\nEarlier Wednesday, Trump told Fox Business Network he would impose additional duties on Chinese imports if he does not clinch a deal with Xi.\nMSCI's gauge of stocks across the globe shed 0.2% and the FTSEurofirst 300 index of leading European shares closed down 0.3%.\nU.S. stocks rose through much of the session, but Wall Street gave back gains and the benchmark S&P 500 and Dow industrials closed lower.\nThe Dow Jones Industrial Average fell 11.4 points, or 0.04%, to 26,536.82. The S&P 500 lost 3.6 points, or 0.12%, to 2,913.78 and the Nasdaq Composite added 25.25 points, or 0.32%, to 7,909.97.\nGold dipped, snapping a six-session streak of gains. Prices hit a six-year peak of $1,438.63 on Tuesday, mostly on expectations the Fed would cut rates.\nU.S. gold futures settled 0.2% lower to $1,415.40, but remained above $1,400.\nThe Fed is still on target to cut rates in July but that will not spur the economy, Kelly said.\n\"If they start to cut rates it will not boost economic growth and very likely it's the start of serious cuts, not just one,\" he said.\nBitcoin jumped to an 18-month high, as investors looked for alternative investments amid geopolitical tension, and cheered prospects that Facebook Inc's Libra token could push cryptocurrencies into the mainstream.The greenback traded at break-even against the euro at $1.1365, and the dollar index edged up 0.09%.\nThe Japanese yen weakened 0.58% versus the greenback at 107.79 per dollar.\nThe benchmark 10-year U.S. Treasury note fell 16/32 in price to lift its yield to 2.0485%.\nGermany's 10-year bond yield nudged off record lows, with the Bund yielding minus 0.306%, just above record lows hit Tuesday at almost minus 0.34%.\nOil prices rose ...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[27833, 'bitcoin-falls-by-1-400-after-crash-of-major-crypto-exchange-coinbase', 157009, 'Bitcoin Falls by $1,400 After Crash of Major Crypto Exchange Coinbase', '2019-06-26 23:25:00', 'Bitcoin has fallen by $1,400 on June 26, following reports of performance issues on the website of major trading platform Coinbase.', 'Bitcoin’s (BTC) price fell by $1,400 within minutes after a crash of United States-based cryptocurrency trading platform Coinbase.Coinbase first reported that it was investigating an issue in which its API and website were not functioning properly at 1:47 p.m. PDT on its status website.\\xa0According to the daily chart of bitcoin price on Coin360, bitcoin’s price and market cap began to plummet around 1:25 p.m. PST, just minutes before Coinbase’s first announcement.Bitcoin 24-hour price chart.

It easily covered a distance from $10,000 to $13,000 within five days. This shows massive buying that has seen its market dominance reach 62.1% for the first time since April 2017. The recovery in the crypto markets is being led by the leader, which is positive for the asset class.\\xa0With this recovery, bitcoin once again rises from the dumps as the doubters continued to write its obituary. Its low correlation with other traditional asset classes makes it an interesting bet for the institutional players wanting to diversify their portfolio due to the ongoing geopolitical tension and trade issues. Deutsche Bank exec Jim Reid said that aggressive rate cuts by central banks was also a contributing factor in the recent surge in bitcoin prices.Data from institutional crypto lender Genesis Capital shows a significant increase in institutional activity in the past 12 months. While the rise is parabolic and is not sustainable, an important factor is that the rally had been climbing a wall of worry until it broke out of $10,000. Since then, analysts have again started to project sky-high targets for bitcoin. When that happens and it becomes easy to make money, a short-term top is likely.\\xa0BTC/USDContrary to our assumption, bitcoin easily cleared the $12,000 and $13,000 overhead resistance levels on the same day. Such strong buying near critical resistance levels suggests huge demand. When the momentum is so strong, it is difficult to point a particular level where the rally will stall. Still, traders can keep a few targets in mind.\\xa0With the breakout and close (UTC time frame) above $13,000, the next level to watch is the Fibonacci extension level of $14,273.84 and above it $15,433.33. If both these levels are scaled, the next target is $17,310.14.However, the RSI has reached close to 89, which indicates that the rally is hugely overbought in the short term. Even in the previous bull phase, the highest reading recorded was about 93 on the RSI. This shows that the markets are vulnerable to a sharp pullback.In this leg of the rise, the BTC/USD pair has soared vertically without even attempting to form a base at any level. Therefore, on the way down, the nearest logical support is way lower at the 20-day EMA. After such a sharp up move, we anticipate the volatility to remain high for the next few days. At the risk of being left out, we believe that the pair does not offer any buying opportunities at the current levels as the risk to reward ratio is heavily skewed to the downside.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0ETH/USDEther (ETH) has broken out of the overhead resistance at $320.840. If the bulls close (UTC time frame) the price above this level, it will complete a rounding bottom pattern, which is a reversal formation and has a target objective of $557.43.Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which suggests that the bulls are in command. We will wait for a retest of the breakout level before recommending a long position in it. The ETH/USD pair will indicate weakness if the price reverses direction and plummets below $320.840.XRP/USDRipple (XRP) held the pullback to the breakout level of the symmetrical triangle on June 24. This is a positive sign. Both the moving averages are sloping up and the RSI is in positive territory, which shows that the bulls are in command. They will now try to push the price above the overhead resistance of $0.50500. If successful, it can move up to $0.57259 and above it to $0.6250.\\xa0Contrary to our expectation, if the XRP/USD pair fails to gain ground, it can dip back to the breakout level of the triangle once again. The 20-day EMA is just below this level, hence, we expect it to act as a strong support; but if it breaks down, a drop to the 50-day SMA is probable. Traders can trail the stop loss on the long position to $0.43.\\xa0BCH/USDBitcoin cash (BCH) is attempting to resume the up move. The price can now move up to the resistance line of the channel. This had proved to be a major barrier in the past but if the bulls can scale above the channel, a rally to $639 and above it to $889 is probable.On the contrary, if the BCH/USD pair fails to break out of the channel, it might trade between the 20-day EMA and the resistance line of the channel. Both the moving averages are trending up and the RSI is in the overbought zone, which suggests that bulls have the upper hand. The pair will lose momentum on a breakdown of the 20-day EMA and the trend will turn down if the support line of the channel gives way.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) dipped to the 20-day EMA on June 25, but held it. The bulls will now again try to break out and sustain above $140.3450. If successful, the uptrend will resume that can carry the price to $158.91 and above it to $184.7949. The up-sloping moving averages and the RSI in the positive zone show that bulls are at an advantage.If the LTC/USD pair fails to scale above the overhead resistance, the bears will attempt to sink it below the 20-day EMA. If this support cracks, the uptrend will lose momentum and a drop to the 50-day SMA is probable. Therefore, traders can retain the stop loss on the remaining long position to just below the 20-day EMA.\\xa0EOS/USDEOS corrected to the breakout level of $6.8299 on June 25.

Statistical data gathered by Crypterium shows that the average value of transactions processed by the payment platforms stabilized during last year&#x2019;s decline in a relatively narrow range between $1,000-2,000. The volume of crypto payments and the average amount have increased in 2019, reaching a seven-month high in April. The researchers believe that, helped by the crypto market recovery, the increasing number of payment providers in the sector which offer new solutions for both merchants and customers will help the industry achieve &#x201C;gradual and sustainable organic growth.&#x201D; The report further identifies the regions that concentrate the most crypto holders who are using digital assets to make payments. The authors emphasize that the number of wallet addresses has been constantly growing and active wallets worldwide have reached 34 million in the first quarter of 2019, increasing by 44% just in the last 12 months. According to another study that news.Bitcoin.com covered in May, the figure is even higher &#x2013; 36 million. High Income Countries Adopt Cryptocurrency Payments Faster A key finding in the Crypterium analysis is that cryptocurrency payments are more popular in high-income nations in general. Based on data for trading and mining activity from the largest digital asset exchanges and mining pools, Crypterium has shortlisted the top 20 countries. Coins are increasingly used as a payment instrument in the United States, United Kingdom, Russia and China. The company concludes that their adoption is triggered by different factors depending on the jurisdiction. The most common reasons to trust cryptocurrencies include the desire to maximize efficiency in payments and the need to protect assets against hyperinflation. To better understand why people choose decentralized coins over traditional payment methods like cash, fiat payment processors and bank cards, the researchers have analyzed various factors such as debit and credit card ownership, internet accessibility, mobile phone ownership as well as macroeconomic indicators including gross domestic product (GDP) per capita and share of shadow economy. Based on their qualitative and quantitative assessment, they have grouped the leading 20 countries in three categories: Innovators, Shadows and Survivors. The United States, Canada, Germany, France, England, the Netherlands, Italy, Spain, Japan, and South Korea are the so-called &#x2018;innovators.&#x2019; They are characterized by deep penetration of banking and digital financial services and unrestricted access to mobile services. According to the authors, they offer the best opportunity for merchants to capitalize on increasing crypto adoption as most customers there have access to the internet and own a mobile device. Medium to low income countries &#x2013; Russia, China, Brazil, Poland, and Turkey &#x2013; have been labeled as &#x2018;shadows.&#x2019; Many of their citizens have lost trust in government institutions, banks and national currencies due to economic recessions. They often see cryptocurrencies as an alternative tool to make payments and receive income. The group of the &#x2018;survivors&#x2019; includes Vietnam, India, Iran, Venezuela, and South Africa. Their populations have poor access to traditional banking services and they look at digital coins as a way to overcome economic challenges like hyperinflation and save on money transfers. Debit Cards Remain Viable Option for Crypto Users Until wider adoption comes around, debit cards tied to crypto wallets are likely to continue to offer the most applicable solution for cryptocurrency users who want to spend their electronic cash on a wide range of products and services. The prepaid cards that can be loaded with digital coins can be used in both brick and mortar stores and online platforms to purchase anything that can be bought with regular bank cards as they convert your crypto assets and merchants are paid with fiat money.

He was nearly [370 Pounds](https://www.google.com/amp/s/heightline.com/shaquille-oneal-height-weight-and-body-measurements/amp/) in LA, and still had very nice footwork. However, Shaq became quite a polarizing figure, just like Kanye.

Ocean Falls Blockchain has strategically leveraged an inexpensive supply of electricity, to conduct its mining activities at a low cost, and with minimal environmental impact. The equity offering will be made on the Hyperion Exchange in the form of a regulated security token. FORK also announces that it has sold its masternode stakes in the Dash and Loki blockchain networks at a profit. Despite FORK's decision to sell these stakes, it continues to operate its masternode pooling platform for clients as a key part of its operations. Vancouver, British Columbia--(Newsfile Corp. - May 30, 2019) - METAVERSE CAPITAL CORP. (CSE: FORK) (OTC: GBCHF) (\"FORK\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce that pending regulatory approval, it has been contracted by Hyperion Crypto Exchange Inc. (\"Hyperion\") to administer an equity offering for Ocean Falls Blockchain Corp. (\"Ocean Falls\") on the Hyperion Exchange, a SEC-registered alternative trading system (ATS) that acts as a blockchain-based trading platform for non-bearer tokenized securities, also known as \"security tokens\". Ocean Falls is a cryptocurrency mining operator based out of Ocean Falls, British Columbia, with a focus on mining Bitcoin (BTC) cryptocurrency. Ocean Falls leverages an inexpensive supply of electricity, and is engaged in the development of advanced mining technologies including heat capture and transfer to maximize efficiency and minimize environmental impact. Led by an experienced team of cryptocurrency miners, Ocean Falls' operations are slated to expand both in Ocean Falls and at other locations along the central coast of British Columbia upon appropriate capitalization. Under its agreement with Hyperion, FORK will perform tasks related to the equity offering of Ocean Falls, including compliance checks for its offering as a security token, preparation of media materials, marketing and promotion of the equity offering, as well as interacting with equity offering participants to address questions and concerns. Story continues The performance of Bitcoin has seen considerable improvement in the course of 2019, with the asset seeing significant year-to-date appreciation, outlined below. With this growth, as well as recent technology developments with respect to the use of cryptocurrencies (as detailed in FORK's May 21, 2019 release announcing its relationship with Spend Group), Ocean Falls is well-positioned to generate shareholder value from its cryptocurrency mining activities. Bitcoin [1] (January 1, 2019 / May 29, 2019) (Change in %) Price (USD $3,800 / USD $8,600) (+126.3%) 24 Hour Volume (USD $4.3 billion / USD $23.5 billion) (+446.5%) Market Capitalization (USD $65 billion / USD $153 billion) (+135.4%) FORK is also pleased to announce it has sold its stake of Dash (DASH) and Loki (LOKI) masternodes as part of its masternode pooling platform, and this sale was made at a profit. Despite FORK's decision to sell its stake in these masternodes, the Company's masternode pooling platform remains active for clients, and is a key part of FORK's operations. As of this writing, FORK continues to be one of the largest stakeholders on each of the blockchain networks listed below, in either or both of direct holdings of a given network's crypto asset, or equity in a given network's operations (e.g. staking for witnesses or masternodes). Ammbr (Decentralized Internet service provider - http://ammbr.com ) KodakONE (Image rights management platform - http://kodakone.com ) MeVu (Peer-to-peer sports wagering - http://mevu.bet ) Nuvo (Censorship-immune social media and communications - http://nuvo.cash ) Furthermore, FORK will be receiving security token stakes in the offerings of Spend Group, as well as Ocean Falls, upon meeting the conditions outlined in the respective agreements of each relationship. FORK President and CEO Shidan Gouran said, \"Traditional stock markets have become less and less appealing for equity offerings, between the fixed costs of listing, and the ongoing costs and hassle related to compliance. As a security token marketplace, the Hyperion Exchange overcomes much of this, giving companies and investors alike access to a more robust and dynamic range of securities without the drawbacks of traditional exchanges. We are thrilled to have Hyperion's vote of confidence to administer this equity sale for its client Ocean Falls, and we look forward to generating a positive outcome from this equity offering which will have multi-faceted benefits for the blockchain and crypto spaces.\" Hyperion CEO Michael Zavet commented, \"We are most pleased that Ocean Falls has made the decision to list on the Hyperion Exchange, as this will not only be a great advance for security tokens, but also for the crypto space at large. A major criticism of cryptocurrencies such as Bitcoin is the amount of electricity that is consumed by mining activities. Through a strategic approach to maximizing efficiency and diverting heat output, Ocean Falls has found a way to mine Bitcoin in a manner that is friendly to the environment. We view Ocean Falls as a company that is run with good business sense and conscious ethical values, and we look forward to a productive security token listing for them under FORK's administration.\" Ocean Falls Founder Kevin Day added, \"With the crypto markets performing as well as they have been in the past month, we are very excited to be getting listed on a public exchange. The boom for cryptocurrencies may have taken place between late 2017 and early 2018, but the markets have matured quite a bit since then, between more seamless solutions for using crypto at retail, and advances in the participation of institutional investors. Our computing facilities can reliably mine Bitcoin at a supreme level of efficiency that many competing mining facility operators cannot attain. We are very much looking forward to working with FORK and Hyperion in conducting our equity offering.\" More information about Ocean Falls may be found at http://oceanfallsblockchain.com .

The impact of a new migration accord to be unveiled Friday is particularly suspect, as Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and the leaders of three Central American countries that produce much of the irregular migration to the US all declined invitations to the summit. Close to 20 leaders, including the President of Brazil and the Prime Minister of Canada, together with the head of the Organization of American States, Luis Almagro, are scheduled to deliver speeches on Friday. The event will wrap up with three official stakeholder forums occurring at the same time to promote greater dialog between the regions government and its people and businesses. Key Developments Bidens Lackluster Los Angeles Summit Exposes Divided Hemisphere Brazil Seeks US Help to Stop Illegal Trade of Amazon Timber Bolsonaro Says Meeting With Biden Sensational Bolsonaro Fears Worst as Writer, Expert Missing in Amazon (All times are Los Angeles, Pacific Time.) Blinken Defends US Exclusion of Autocracies (5:12 p.m.) Secretary of State Antony Blinken defended the Biden administration decision to exclude the governments of Cuba, Nicaragua and Venezuela from the summit, saying that members of civil society from the countries who came to Los Angeles better represent their people. I would argue that they are more representative of the people in those respective countries than their current governments or regimes, Blinken said at a news conference Friday to conclude the summit. I know some people like to focus on differences of opinion in who was here, but everyone was fully united on what we did here, Blinken said. The decision angered some Latin American leaders who argued the summit should include all nations in the hemisphere. But the Biden administration wanted a major theme of the summit to be the importance of democratic government. Story continues Mexican President Andres Manuel Lopez Obrador and some other leaders refused invitations to Los Angeles over the issue, sending cabinet officials instead. Diplomat Says US Tops China in Latin American Influence (4:55 p.m.) The State Departments top diplomat for Latin American insisted US influence continues to top Chinas in the Western hemisphere, citing aid to Central America and the Biden administrations donations of more than 70 million Covid-19 shots to the regions countries. When you look at what weve done, the Chinese pale in comparison, Assistant Secretary of State for Western Hemisphere Affairs Brian Nichols said in an interview on Friday. But we recognize as a hemisphere, we need to work together as partners, not as the US as the boss telling people what to do, but as partners to advance the shared values that we have, he said. China has invested and loaned billions of dollars to Latin American countries in recent years, and the Beijing government accused the US this week of trying to fence-off the region from outside influence, calling Washington selfish. Blinken said Friday at his news conference that the US provides about $1.3 trillion in direct foreign investment in the Americas annually. Caribbean Nations Blame Rich Countries for Environmental Degradation (2:30 p.m.) The Caribbean countries had great expectations ahead of this summit, with leaders awaiting a new US-Caribbean climate and energy partnership that the White House launched launched on Thursday. These nations are among the hardest impacted by climate change while their tourism industries were upended by Covid-19. On Friday, some of the small Caribbean island urged more action against climate change -- saying it was one of the main drivers of irregular migration and ballooning debt in the region. Antigua and Barbuda Prime Minister Gaston Browne said large industrialized countries that fuel climate degradation had a moral obligation to help nations where the weather phenomenon was most pronounced. Our countries have suffered and continue to suffer even though we are the least contributors to climate change, he said. This is one of the greatest injustices that exists today. And it requires the attention of the United States and others. He also urged Washington to work more closely with China in the region. We recognize that the United States alone cannot do everything, he said. Hence we urge cooperation between the U.S. govt and other governments such as a China, which is playing a constructive role in Latin America and the Caribbean. Biden Unveils 20-Country Pact to Manage Migrants (2:04 p.m.) Biden announced a 20-country accord on regional migration, addressing an issue that is not only politically fraught in the US but burdens many other countries in Latin America. We know that safe, orderly, legal migration is good for all our economies, Biden said. But we need to halt the dangerous and unlawful ways people are migrating, the dangerous ways. Unlawful migration is not acceptable. The pact, billed by the White House as the capstone of the Los Angeles summit, proposes financial aid for countries hosting large numbers of migrants as well as nations with high emigration. The declaration is a non-binding set of principles that includes expanding legal pathways to live and work, financial assistance for communities affected by migration, coordinated emergency responses and more humane border enforcement. Countries like Ecuador and Colombia have pledged to provide temporary status for hundreds of thousands more people fleeing Venezuela, while Canada and Spain promised to accept more migrant workers from Mexico and Central America. The US pledged $314 million in humanitarian assistance for migrants, including people who have fled Venezuela, as well as modest increases in temporary work visas and refugee resettlement. The US has been the most popular destination for asylum seekers for years, however, and the commitments announced are unlikely to make a major difference absent action from the US Congress on an overhaul of immigration laws. Perus Castillo Proposes Regional Subsidies to Fertilizers (1:25 p.m.) In his speech at the plenary session, Peruvian President Pedro Castillo proposed establishing a regional credit program with the support of the Inter-American Development Bank to subsidize the purchase of fertilizers and basic foods. He also urged for coordination in the region to find additional solutions to fight the shortage of the key products applied to supply plant nutrients, which is hitting the Andean country hard. Peru has brought its serious concern about the fertilizer shortage to the OAS, encouraging the approval of a solution to monitor the situation, Castillo said, referring to the Organization of American States. Peru received 45,000 tons of fertilizers at the beginning of June after months of urea shortage, but it will only partially supply farmers for the next 45 days. The country is running against time to purchase the fertilizers it needs before seedtime in August. Brazil Attentive to Economic Issues Affecting World, Bolsonaro Says (11:25 a.m.) The summit is a much-awaited opportunity to deal with a post-pandemic world and its economic challenges, Brazils President Jair Bolsonaro said at a plenary session Friday. Latin Americans largest economy is a key player in global food security and its agribusiness complies with strict environmental laws, Bolsonaro told leaders gathered in Los Angeles, adding that such a sustainable agricultural power doesnt need to explore the Amazon territory to expand output. Brazil will continue to import natural gas from Bolivia and is seeking to hold talks with Argentine President Alberto Fernandez on a gas agreement related to the Vaca Muerta field. Bolsonaro also said his government is working relentlessly to find British journalist Dom Phillips and Brazilian indigenist Bruno Araujo Pereira, who went missing in the Amazon rainforest on Sunday.

Binance Coin (+2.43%), Cardano’s ADA (+0.20%), Polkadot (+0.31%), and Ripple’s XRP (+0.95%) found early support. Story continues It was a bearish start for the rest of the pack, however. At the time of writing, Crypto.com Coin was down by 1.04% to lead the way down. For the Bitcoin Day Ahead Bitcoin would need to move back through the pivot level at $58,721 to bring the first major resistance level at $59,486 into play. Support from the broader market would be needed for Bitcoin to break back through to $59,400 levels. Barring an extended crypto rally, the first major resistance level and resistance at $60,000 would likely cap any upside. In the event of an extended crypto rally, Bitcoin could test resistance at 14 th March swing hi $61,699.0 before easing back. The second major resistance level sits at $60,249. Failure to move back through the $58,721 pivot would bring the first major support level at $57,958 into play. Barring an extended sell-off on the day, Bitcoin should steer clear of sub-$57,000 levels. The second major support level at $57,193 should limit the downside.

This measurement climbs or falls depending on the amount of power consumed (or “hashrate” produced) by the network at a given time. Bitcoin is programmed to adjust its difficulty level every 2,016 blocks, or roughly every 2 weeks to ensure that new blocks are mined at a stable rate.\nThis difficulty is measured on a relative scoring scale where Bitcoin launched with a mining difficulty of “1,” the lowest it’s ever been. (Difficulty kind of works like Google Search scores in that the scoring system is internal and has no reference point or unit for measurement outside of the networks themselves).\nRelated:BOJ Starts Central Bank Digital Currency Experiments\nAs of today’s adjustment, Bitcoin’s current mining difficulty is 23.1 trillion, according to data pulled from this CoinDesk journalist’s Bitcoin node. Per figures fromBTC.com, this is a roughly 6% increase from its last level of 21.8 trillion, which makes it the second largest adjustment of the year and the fifth upward adjustment in the last six difficulty periods.\nThe difficulty adjustment is arguably one of Bitcoin’s most important features as it ensures block times remain relatively stable while also preventing a large miner from eating up too much hashrate.\nThis latest adjustment is a notable bump, Compass mining CEO Whit Gibbs told CoinDesk, because it’s likely attributable to tens of thousands of new machines coming online that were previously on backorder in the ASIC supply chain.\nHe said the current adjustment is just a sampler of the flood of hashrate that will come online in 2022 as moreback-ordered shipmentsare filled.\nRelated:Crypto Long & Short: Bitcoin Outflows Aren't the Bullish Signal You Think They Are\n“Today’s moderately large difficulty increase is not surprising, and I expect it’s only a taste of what will come later in this year and into 2022, as delayed machine shipments start arriving and being deployed. The pending flood of hashrate about to enter the market will only continue pushing bitcoin’s mining difficulty higher, which should track with bitcoin’s price,” Gibbs said.\nAs bitcoin’s price has gone stratospheric, mining investments are shooting the moon along with it. North American miners likeHut 8,Marathon,Blockcapand others have used 2021 as an opportunity to aggressively expand operational capacity. As these machines come online, Bitcoin’s hashrate and difficulty are rising in step with miner revenues, whichhit a record $1.5 billionin the month of March.\n• Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High as Delayed ASIC Shipments Come Online\n• Bitcoin Mining Difficulty Hits All-Time High as Delayed ASIC Shipments Come Online || Bitcoin’s mining difficulty hit an all-time high today after a roughly 6% increase, a move that follows a record month in earnings for...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[63667, 'tyler-winklevoss-thinks-bitcoin-is-past-the-risk-of-a-us-ban', 41145, 'Tyler Winklevoss thinks Bitcoin is past the risk of a US ban ', '2021-04-02 22:46:39', 'Bitcoin has likely become too interwoven into the world for a ban to be plausible, says the Gemini CEO.', 'The United States government has increasingly stepped up its overwatch on crypto in recent years, although an outright ban on Bitcoin is now unlikely — at least according to Gemini CEO and co-founder Tyler Winklevoss.“I think, if we were back in 2013, this would be kind of an open question,” Winklevoss told podcaster Peter McCormack when asked about regulation and a Bitcoin (BTC) ban\\xa0during a Friday episode of the What Bitcoin Did podcast:“I think that the U.S. will never outlaw Bitcoin. There’s too much precedent that’s been set in the courts. The Coinflip order, which was a CFTC [Commodity Futures Trading Commission] enforcement action which was upheld in the courts, considered Bitcoin a commodity like gold.”Back in 2015, the CFTC referred to BTC as a commodity in the midst of dealing with Derivabit, a BTC options trading platform. According to the CFTC, Derivabit, a product of a company called Coinflip, was not compliant with the governing body at the time. “We are a New York trust company regulated by the New York Department of Financial Services,” Winklevoss continued, referring to Gemini. “So much would have to be undone,” he said of a Bitcoin ban, adding:“You’re talking about like companies that are providing careers, building the economy, some of them are going public. They’re going to become drivers of the stock market. To unroll that back is so unlikely to me. Of course it’s not 0%, but it might as well be.” The crypto space as it is known today began in 2009 with the inception of Bitcoin. Since then, the asset has given birth to an entire ecosystem, with mainstream players becoming involved in various capacities. Regulatory talk has also continued moving forward in terms of providing and enforcing guidelines as they relate to crypto. Winklevoss additionally mentioned regulators as stakeholders. They have the well-being of companies and consumers in mind, but some also may hold BTC and see it as valuable. He also noted the trend of crypto industry leaders finding their way into government positions. “I think it’s like such a strong amount of people who believe in this in the U.S. that I think it’s like next to 0% chance that that sort of gets rolled back for whatever reason,” he said, adding:“I think the same for the U.K. and Europe. Singapore we’re in a licensing process with the MAS [Monetary Authority of Singapore], their top regulator there. They are embracing it. All of the jurisdictions that are free markets and open markets and believe in capitalism, believe in Bitcoin, believe in crypto, and I think see it as an opportunity more than anything than a threat.” He also pointed out that stopping Bitcoin would essentially require putting significant restrictions on the internet as a whole, which would affect other economic aspects. Speaking of crypto leaders finding their way to government positions, the Financial Crimes Enforcement Network recently chose a former Chainalysis exec as its incoming acting director. \\n'], [63664, 'latest-episode-of-the-falcon-and-the-winter-soldier-involves-massive-bitcoin-bounty', 18820, 'Latest episode of ‘The Falcon and the Winter Soldier’ involves massive Bitcoin bounty ', '2021-04-02 20:56:34', \"Is it because of Bitcoin’s price, or simply the asset's ever-increasing mainstream ubiquity?

Contrary to this assumption, if the price once again reverses direction from the overhead resistance zone, the BTC/USDT pair could drop to the 50-day simple moving average ($53,362).

Continuous massive power disruptions, in parallel, are fueling the anger of the people towards crypto miners. Public Officials to Face Bigger Penalties According to a report published by E Daily, the Abkhazian government revealed that it’s due to present a proposal to fine miners and also file criminal charges against them. The plan is to set fines up to $8,000, which is a considerable amount of money, as it is the same yearly average income per individual in the de facto South Caucasus state, equal to 20 minimum national wages. But such punishments are the lowest ones considered in the proposal. In fact, the government seeks to hit back with even more significant penalties against public servants who are caught in crypto mining activities, as well as companies running rigs, with up to 5,000 minimum national wages. However, the report detailed the punishments that could face people, public officials, or businesses for “repeated offenses” in regards to crypto mining activities: For repeated committing of an administrative offense shall entail the imposition of an administrative fine on individual entrepreneurs, legal entities and citizens in the amount of 50 minimum wages for each kilowatt of power of the equipment connected to power grids for carrying out activities for the extraction of cryptocurrencies, with the confiscation of said equipment, on officials – in the amount of 5,000 minimum wages. Anyone who attempts to connect mining rigs on power grids to a large-scale farm in Abkhazia (recognized by most countries as part of Georgia) could face a jail time of one to three years, together with the seizing of the equipment. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Government Extended Again Its &#8216;Temporary Ban&#8217; on Crypto Mining The government also published a decree which extended its “temporary ban” on crypto mining until, at least, March 31, 2022.

The price has been driving the hashrate higher as miners are dedicating a lot of resources toward finding bitcoin blocks. On March 27, 2021, the Bitcoin hashrate spiked to 195 EH/s coming awfully close to the 200 EH/s zone for the first time ever. The continuous rise in hashrate has also pushed up the crypto network&#x2019;s mining difficulty which is currently at 23.14 trillion. Mining difficulty is essentially how hard it is to mine a BTC block and obtain the coinbase reward and transaction fees. The hashpower dedicated to the network can make the difficulty change and the higher the hashrate, the higher the difficulty, and vice versa. Currently, the Bitcoin hashrate is coasting along at 160 exahash per second. Every two weeks or every 2,016 blocks found, the difficulty changes and in 13 days it might increase over 5%. Of course, this mining difficulty change will depend on the amount of hashrate produced at that time. Just recently, the blockchain research company Arcane Research published a report that explained BTC miners captured more than $1.5 billion in fees and rewards in March.

So in simple summarized paragraphs I just wanted to list what I know in the way of the main additions and improvements, especially for new comers\\n\\n# Base protocol changes\\n\\n\\\\#1 **Removal of 1mb limit on blocksize.** Greatly Increasing the transaction capacity of bitcoin cash, massively improving transaction certainty and lowering fees. This also prevents transaction fee market like on BTC and enables rapid 0 confirmation transactions to have more security and certainty of success. It also allowing miners to dynamically choose what the blocksize limit should be based on their costs and hardware capabilities (which is always improving at a great rate). An important knock-on effect of high tx capacity/blocksize is the energy efficiency of BCH in terms of mining energy use per transaction confirmed, currently this is approx 100x lower than BTC (assuming price parity) and is improving all of the time.\\n\\n\\\\#2 **Avoidance of segwit.** Segwit was implemented on BTC in late 2017. It is a messy and overengineered way to increase the block size limit by a very small amount and prevent TX malleability on some BTC transactions  (Tx malleability has been fixed on BCH much more cleanly with schnorr signatures) .Segwit[ changed BTC fundamentally from the bitcoin white paper definition of bitcoin as a \"chain of digital signatures\" and alters the incentives in the network as a whole.](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VoFb3mcxluY)\\n\\n\\\\#3 **Removal of Replace-by-fee (RBF)** This \"feature\" was added to [allow people to double spend BTC more easily](https://bitcoinops.org/en/topics/replace-by-fee/), it was created because transactions often get stuck on BTC due to the prohibitively small blocksize. RBF makes 0 confirmation transactions completely untrustworthy so that BTC is far less safe to accept as a means of payment in small day-to-day transactions where speed matters. [RBF has been used successfully to rob businesses out of BTC](https://www.ccn.com/bitcoin-atm-double-spenders-police-need-help-identifying-four-criminals/)\\n\\n\\\\#4 **Enabling op-codes** To allow for  smart functionality on bitcoin cash, like the creation of colored coins and representative tokens, alongside the ability to perform smart contracts, but in a more simplified and scalable manner than ethereum’s solidity programming language. This has enabled BCH to be much more than just cash, it can now perform more complex financial and legal actions by acting as a decentralized, smart and low cost platform of trust.\\n\\n\\\\#5 **Enabling Schnorr signatures**. Schnorr signatures are a cleaner and more efficient way to sign and validate transactions, Schnorr signatures are provably non-malleable and allow multiple parties to collaborate to produce a signature that is valid for the sum of their public keys. This is the building block for various higher-level constructions that [improve efficiency and privacy](https://blog.bitcoin.com/an-expert-explains-the-upcoming-bch-network-upgrade/)\\n\\n\\\\#6 **Canonical Transaction Ordering**  **(CTOR)** This has many efficiency benefits, especially in the context of having very large blocks. Miners no longer need to discover a valid ordering saving About 70% of block template creation time. No need to worry about intermediate states during block validation. This ensures that block validation can be perfectly parallel \\\\[3\\\\]. Ethereum’s scalability suffers from having a large number of intermediate states, for example. It makes encoding and transmitting blocks a lot easier by allowing nodes to communicate only the transactions that differ between their mempools and a recently published block. This is what Graphene \\\\[4\\\\] does, and it works very efficiently with CTOR. CTOR reduces system complexity, eliminating the entire class of attack vectors where a malicious miner can publish a large block with a transaction ordering that is as slow to validate as possible.  [Read in depth here](https://jtoomim.medium.com/canonical-block-order-or-dbe3ac48bcd3)\\n\\n\\\\#7 **Graphene**  Graphene, at a high level, is an efficient means of communicating new blocks to the network. The content of blocks, transactions, must be validated by others on the network. The validation process takes some time and some of the validation done by nodes can be unnecessary or redundant, slowing down block propagation. Making this process more efficient and squeezing out bottlenecks can allow bigger and bigger blocks of transactions to flow throughout the network without issues. A more efficient means of propagation means the possibility for greater transaction throughput in the future.\\xa0The graphene protocol makes use of two technologies: bloom filters and invertible bloom look up tables (IBLTs). These technologies help reconcile between what a node already knows and what information it needs to know from another node. Previously, without the help of Graphene, nodes were communicating blocks to others by dumping all of the raw transaction data on them without taking into account what the node they’re communicating with already knows.

CashShuffle is a protocol for allowing users to combine their transactions with others, creating obfuscation. It builds upon CoinShuffle and adds a matching service. As such, it is a more complete and usable protocol. Cash fusion is Trustless, obfuscated coin consolidation.\\n\\n\\\\#2 **Simple-ledger-protocol**  The simple ledger protocol (SLP) is a token protocol for the Bitcoin Cash network, that enables anyone to create and manage tokens on-chain. The simple ledger protocol is arguably the simplest and easiest to use token token creation system across all blockchains yet. SLP tokens can easily be created, traded, and managed on the Bitcoin Cash blockchain within seconds for fractions of a penny per transaction.\\n\\n\\\\#3 **Smart-BCH**  Smart Bitcoin Cash is a sidechain for Bitcoin Cash and has an aim to explore new ideas and unlock novel possibilities.

Overnight falls in Asian stockmarkets, after a senior Chinese official expressed wariness about the risk of asset bubbles in foreign markets, and a drop in oil prices also weighed on sentiment, but the dollar was steady, along with U.S. Treasuries. Analysts said a pause was to be expected after European shares had marked their best day in nearly four months on Monday when bond markets stabilized from a sharp selloff last week. \"We are in the yield waiting room to see whether central bankers push back this week on the ambivalence we saw last week about interest rates,\" said Michael Hewson, chief market analyst at CMC Markets. \"Potentially that was a mistake, giving the impression that the U.S. did not really care about sharp rises in yields and sending the wrong message.\" The pan-European STOXX 600 share index edged 0.2% higher, with Paris down, while Frankfurt and London eked out slim gains. Investors will scrutinise speeches from U.S. Federal Reserve officials, starting with Lael Brainard at 1800 GMT on Tuesday, for any tweaks to messages on bond yields. European Central Bank vice president Luis de Guindos said the ECB has the flexibility to counter any undesired rise in bond yields, helping to soothe the German bund in early trading. \"We will have to see whether this increase in nominal yields will have a negative impact on financing conditions,\" de Guindos told Portuguese newspaper Público in comments published on Tuesday. Among the day's economic data, German retail sales tumbled more than expected in January as an ongoing lockdown to fight the coronavirus pandemic curtailed retail spending. U.S. stock futures were weaker . CHINA BUBBLE WARNING Story continues Shares in mainland China and Hong Kong fell after a top regulatory official expressed concerns about the risk of bubbles bursting in foreign markets. \"Financial markets are trading at high levels in Europe, the U.S. and other developed countries, which runs counter to the real economy,\" Guo Shuqing, head of the China Banking and Insurance Regulatory Commission, told a news conference. Chinese blue-chips slipped 1.3% while Hong Kong's Hang Seng Index lost 1.2%. MSCI's broadest index of Asia-Pacific shares outside Japan slipped 0.33%. Japan's Nikkei was down 0.8% as some investors booked profits on defensive energy and utility shares before the end of the fiscal year this month. U.S. stocks rallied overnight, with the S&P 500 posting its best day in nearly nine months, as bond markets calmed after a month-long selloff. U.S. stocks were roiled last week when a selloff in Treasuries pushed the 10-year Treasury yield to a one-year high of 1.614%. The 10-year yield was flat at 1.4308%. Bitcoin fell 1% to $49,135 after rising nearly 7% on Monday. The U.S. dollar index was up 0.3% against a basket of currencies to stand at 91.32. A stronger greenback weighed on gold, with the yellow metal at $1,719.74 an ounce, down 0.2%. Oil prices slid on expectations that OPEC would agree to raise oil supply at a meeting this week. Brent crude dropped 68 cents, or 1.05%, to $63.01 a barrel. U.S. West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude fell 58 cents, or 0.9%, to $60.05 a barrel.

Should you be foolish enough to approach, the eyesore will encourage you to dig into your wallet and fork over cold hard cash in exchange for make-believe money from the internet... Its...*shudders*...the dreaded crypto ATM. A bizarre artifact of the current cultural moment, these machines have flooded U.S. cities over the past several years, but boom times for the little bitcoin dispensers may soon be at an end. One of their biggest U.S. operators is broke.

By type, Bitcoin has the largest market share worldwide Other emerging cryptocurrencies include Ethereum, Tether, Binance Coin, Dogecoin, etc Cryptocurrency Market size in North America was USD 273 Million in 2020 The demand for crypto has increased due to rising investments in venture capital. Additionally, the increasing popularity of digital assets such as bitcoin and litecoin is likely to accelerate the market in upcoming years. Furthermore, it has been seen that the digital currency is also used in the integration of blockchain technology to get decentralization and control efficient transactions. Thus, advantages such as these are also encouraging people to invest in crypto. For instance, In October 2018, Qtum Chain Foundation made a partnership with Amazon Web Services (AWS) China to use blockchain systems on the AWS cloud. With this collaboration, AWS will be able to help its users in using Amazon Machine Images (AMI) to develop and publish smart contracts easily and efficiently.

By type, it is divided into bitcoin, ether, litecoin, ripple, ether classic, and others. By end-use, it is divided into trading, E-commerce and retail, peer-to-peer payment, and remittance. Based on end use, the trading segment held the market share of 42.8% in 2020, because it focuses on crypto solutions that are used for trading such as Pionex, Cryptohopper, Bitsgap, Coinrule, and others. Lastly, in terms of geography, the market is divided into North America, Europe, Asia Pacific, the Middle East & Africa and Latin America. Driving Factors Focus on Mitigating Financial Crisis and Regional Instability Drives the Demand for Virtual Currency In recent times, financial disaster is one of the primary issues that occurs in the conventional banking system. This financial instability disrupts the economy by lowering the value of money. For instance, ICICI bank of India, in the year 2008, confronted the Lehman brother crisis, which hugely impacted the nation’s economy. But with using bitcoins, and other cryptocurrency, such situations of economic downfall can be avoided. Therefore, Cryptocurrencies are emerging as alternative options in the regions with unstable economical structure, and this has been a major driving factor for the cryptocurrency market growth. Regional Insights North America to Dominate Backed by Presence of Prominent Players North America is expected to remain at the forefront and hold the largest position in the market during the forecast period. This is because in most parts of the region bitcoins have become a medium of exchange for tax purposes rather than the actual currency. Although these are not legally regulated by the government, still many of the countries in the region are focused on using digital currencies. The region’s market stood at USD 273.0 million in 2020. Asia Pacific is expected to showcase significant cryptocurrency market share in upcoming years, owing to several technological developments and acceptance of virtual currency for some platforms within Japan and Taiwan.  Additionally, the strategic collaborations, partnerships by key players are also fueling the regional market. For instance, in January 2020, Z Corporation, Inc. and TaoTao, Inc. collaborated with the financial service agency to widen the crypto market by confirming regulatory compliance in the Japanese market. Competitive Landscape Key Players to Focus on Introduction of New Services to Strengthen the Market Growth The market is consolidated by major companies striving to maintain their position by focusing on new launches, collaborations & partnerships and acquisitions. Such strategies taken up by key players are expected to strengthen its market prospects. Have Any Query?

However, it wasn’t an ordinary weakness, it was a technical closing price reversal top, which means the selling was serious. If confirmed this week, we could see the start of a two to three-week correction. Furthermore, if the selling pressure intensifies over the near-term, we could even see a change in trend to down.\nLast week, theDecember U.S. Dollar Indexsettled at 96.333, down 0.401 or -0.41%.\nAlthough it is often said, that technical analysis precedes the fundamentals, this time the potentially bearish chart pattern appears to be working in sync with a change in the fundamentals.\nFor years, we’ve read that the dollar is being supported by the divergence in monetary policy between the hawkish U.S. Federal Reserve and the dovish central banks. In other words, rising U.S. interest rates at a time when several central banks are still holding rates at historically low levels, have made the dollar a highly desirable asset.\nWe’ve also read that at times, the dollar was being treated as a safe-haven asset. The “go to” asset during times of financial stress. This has been a popular investment theme in 2018 because of the heightened volatility in the stock market, political uncertainty in Washington and geopolitical uncertainty over Brexit and the simmering tension between Italy and the European Union. Furthermore, the stress created from the lingering trade dispute between the United States and China, has also draw investors into the relative safety of the U.S. Dollar.\nEarly last week, the U.S. Dollar hit a 16-month high against a basket of currency. The move occurred without much fanfare because investors have gotten used to the stronger dollar. The early rally was fueled by safe-haven flows ignited by political uncertainties in Europe and fears of a global economic slowdown.\nThe headlines told us that investor confidence had been eroded by “bitter trade tensions between the United States and China, fears of a no-deal Brexit, and a standoff between Rome and Brussels over Italy’s deficit-deepening budget.”\nThe headlines also said the U.S. Federal Reserve is set to raise rates by 25 basis points in December. This was even supported by the CME group’s Fed Watch tool, which put the probability of a December rate hike at 75 percent.\nDespite all these typically supportive factors, the U.S. Dollar Index posted a potentially bearish closing price reversal top. The chart pattern suggests that the selling is greater than the buying at current price levels.\nThe dollar index started strong on Monday, but many investors discounted the move because it was a U.S. holiday. Tuesday, the dollar index finished lower but inside the previous day’s range. On Wednesday, the selling started. This move set the tone for the rest of the week.\nWhat happened Wednesday that changed investor sentiment?\nThe government reported that U.S. consumer prices increased by the most in nine months in October. The report showed that the increase was supported by gains in the cost of gasoline and rents. This further supported the notion that steadily rising inflation would likely keep the Federal Reserve on track to raise interest rates again in December.\nDespite this potentially bullish news, the dollar finished lower. The reason for this was the news was stale. It didn’t reflect the slump in crude oil and gasoline prices. So moving forward, I expect to see overall inflation slow in the months ahead. This news may also be an indication that inflation is not overheating. It may also put less pressure on the Fed to raise rates aggressively in 2019.\nComments from Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell may have also weakened the U.S. Dollar. He said on November 14 that the economy is performing well, but he sees potential risks ahead. These risks include a slowdown in global growth, the fading impact from tax cuts and the cumulative weight of the Fed’s own tightening monetary policy.\nOn Friday, the dollar index fell further, leading to the lower weekly close. The greenback sold off after Fed Vice-Chair Richard Clarida cautioned on global growth. Clarida said the Fed is getting closer to neutral and that there is “some evidence” that the world economy is slowing.\nThe combination of the tame inflation report, comments from Fed Chair Powell on cooling global demand and the dovish comments from Fed Vice Chair Clarida stating the Fed is getting closer to neutral, are all signs the Fed may slow its pace of rate hikes and this should be bearish for the U.S. Dollar.\nThisarticlewas originally posted on FX Empire\n• Crude Oil Price Update – Next Move Will Be Headline Driven – Strengthens Over $58.95, Weakens Under $54.79\n• Bitcoin Cash – ABC / SV, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 17/11/18\n• E-mini S&P 500 Index (ES) Futures Technical Analysis – 2748.50 Controlling Weekly Direction, 2818.00 Most Important Level for Bulls\n• U.S Mortgages – Rates Steady after early November’s Jump\n• Bitcoin – Bulls in Dire Need of a Late Weekend Rally to Avoid sub-$5,000\n• Price of Gold Fundamental Weekly Price Forecast – Technicals, Fundamentals Indicate Bullish Shift in Sentiment || Last week, the U.S. Dollar closed lower against a basket of the currencies.

Those who fail to do so will face fines, which can vary depending on whether the reports were delayed, wrong, or false.\nThe RFB claims that, in December of last year, Brazil saw over 4 billion reals ($1 billion) used to buy and sell cryptocurrencies likebitcoin. This year, given the crypto industry’s growth in the country, annual trading volume between 18 and 45 billion reals is expected ($4.8 to $12.1 billion).\nThe RFB added:\n“In Brazil, there has been a significant increase in the cryptoasset market in recent years, which demonstrates the relevance of the cryptoasset market in the country, mainly for the tax administration, since transactions are subject to income tax on the capital gains eventually earned.”\nThe number of cryptocurrency exchange users in the country, the agency added, is now larger than that of B3 — the country’s stock exchange based in São Paulo. As CCN reported, the country’s biggest investment firm, XP Investimentos, has launched acryptocurrency exchange called XDEX. Leading crypto exchangeHuobi has expanded its operations to Brazil.\nAccording to the country’s tax regulator, various news outlets have been reporting on the use of cryptocurrencies to evade taxes, launder money, and corrupt officials throughout the world. As such, it argues, regulators need to step in. Its note reads:\n“The search of certain agents for anonymity, which is one of the main attractions for the use of certain cryptoassets, must always be combated, even by the tax authority, to increase the risk of criminal practice.”\nThe regulator cites examples from other countries. It points out that in Australia, businesses dealing with cryptocurrencies have to go through checks to combat money laundering and terrorism financing. As CCN reported,Australia’s Post launched a ‘Digital iD’ servicecrypto buyers can use.\nPer the RFB, the European Commission hasconsidered limiting cryptocurrency transactionsand implementing other measures to stop crypto users from evading taxes. In Brazil, crypto exchanges have notably been under scrutiny as earlier this year the government sent them a14-point questionnaireto learn more about them, and their potential to be used to launder money. Brazil’s antitrust watchdog, CADE, has sent them another questionnaire, which they have to answer or face afine that could go up to $25,000.\nMeanwhile, Bitcoin Max, a local exchange, has recentlywon a standoff against two banks, which reopened its accounts to avoid fines. Curiously, investment funds in the country have recently beengiven the green light to invest in cryptocurrencieslike bitcoin, although not directly.\nImages from Shutterstock\nThe postBrazil’s Tax Regulator Wants to Snoop on Cryptocurrency Businessesappeared first onCCN.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"SELL\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":5383.47,\"take_profit\":5725.19,\"forecast_10d\":[4871.49, 4451.87, 4602.17, 4365.94, 4347.11, 3880.76, 4009.97, 3779.13, 3820.72, 4257.42]}"}

', 'With much of the market fixated on Bitcoin’s (BTC) sudden price correction over the weekend, retail interest in digital assets appears to be on the rise, according to the latest statistics from Reddit.The r/dogecoin community added 145,859 weekly subscribers, according to Subreddit Stats. The gains are hardly surprising, given Dogecoin’s (DOGE) dramatic rally over the past week. The meme-based cryptocurrency skyrocketed 400% during that period, bringing its yearly returns to an eye-watering 5,000%. DOGE’s parabolic rally moderated over the weekend, with social media sentiment data from The TIE and Cointelegraph indicating more pain in the short term. That’s because price action is often correlated with social media engagement; a decline in the latter is sometimes a precursor to bearish price action in the near term.\\xa0Meanwhile, the r/CryptoCurrency community, which is devoted to all things digital assets, added 86,838 new subscribers during the week. New community members were welcomed by platinum award recipient u/mirza1h on Sunday. In a subreddit post, u/miraza1h said: “Past week has been insane in the crypto world, so naturally things here weren’t like they normally are. Your curious posts/comments may have been ignored a bit. In the weekend things are a bit more chill, so feel free to ask us anything you want.The user also introduced new subreddit followers to Moon, the native token of the r/CryptoCurrency community.Much like DOGE, the overall cryptocurrency market limped into Sunday’s session, having declined by a cumulative $386 billion, according to CoinMarketCap. The digital-asset market capitalization briefly fell below $1.9 trillion before recovering to around $2 trillion. Massive shakeouts are nothing new for seasoned cryptocurrency investors. Even during bull markets, declines of 20% or more are fairly common, especially after major rallies. Speculation about an abrupt decline in Bitcoin’s hash power and the possibility of United States regulatory action against crypto-friendly banks may have contributed to the decline on Sunday.Even with the latest reversal, the cryptocurrency market is still double the size it was in January\\xa0when it first crossed the $1-trillion milestone.\\n'], [64515, 'top-5-cryptocurrencies-to-watch-this-week-btc-vet-sol-eos-ftt', 83017, 'Top 5 cryptocurrencies to watch this week: BTC, VET, SOL, EOS, FTT', '2021-04-18 19:56:21', 'The bulls are trying to stabilize Bitcoin price and if they succeed, VET, SOL, EOS and FTT could quickly bounce back to their local highs.', 'Bitcoin (BTC) price witnessed a sharp dump to $50,900 on April 18, which some analysts attribute to a drop in hash rate and rumors of possible action by United States regulators against unnamed “financial institutions” alleging crypto-related money laundering.While it is difficult to pinpoint a single reason, the sale\\xa0of roughly $5 billion worth of COIN stock\\xa0by Coinbase executives could have also played a major role in the fall.

Source: Coin360After this most recent pullback, investors will be on the fence on whether they should buy the dips or close their positions in anticipation of further decline? Traders should keep a close watch on the strength in the recovery as that will provide an insight about the next possible move.Let’s study the technicals of the top-5 cryptocurrencies that could attempt to lead the recovery in the next few days.BTC/USDTBitcoin’s failure to rebound off the 20-day exponential moving average ($59,053) on April 17 showed the lack of buying on dips. The selling picked up pace today after the price slipped below the 50-day simple moving average ($56,264).BTC/USDT daily chart. Source: TradingViewHowever, the long tail on today’s candlestick suggests that buyers are attempting to stall the decline at $50,460. If the rebound sustains, the bulls will again try to resume the uptrend but they are likely to face stiff resistance between $61,825.84 and $64,849.27. A breakout of this resistance zone will suggest that the current fall was only a pullback to shake out the weak hands. On the other hand, the failure to sustain the rebound or build upon the bounce in the next few days will indicate that demand dries up at higher levels. That is likely to invigorate the bears who will then try to assert their dominance and break the $50,460 support. If they manage to do that, selling could intensify as the short-term speculators and traders may also dump their positions. That could pull the price down to $43,006.77. This is an important level to watch out for because a break below it will suggest that the BTC/USDT pair has topped out in the short term.BTC/USDT 4-hour chart. Source: TradingViewThe 4-hour chart shows the bulls purchased the drop to $50,460 aggressively but the recovery is facing resistance at $56,500. This suggests that traders stuck at higher levels are closing their positions on rallies.However, the positive sign is that the bulls have not given up the fight. They are trying to defend $53,000 support. This could result in a tight consolidation between $53,000 and $56,500 for a few days. If the price breaks above $56,500, the pair could rally to the 20-EMA, which is again likely to act as a resistance. If the price turns down from this level, the pair could retest $53,000 and then $50,460.The downsloping moving averages and the relative strength index (RSI) near the overbought territory show the bears have the upper hand.VET/USDTVeChain’s (VET) sharp rally on April 16 had pushed the RSI above 87, indicating the rally was getting overheated in the short term. The altcoin tried to extend its up-move on April 17 but the long wick on the day’s candlestick showed that traders booked profits at higher levels.VET/USDT daily chart.

Former SEC Chair Expects &#8216;Fair Amount&#8217; of New Crypto Regulation Harvey Pitt talked about the future of cryptocurrency regulation under the new chairman, Gary Gensler, in an interview with Bloomberg Friday. Pitt is the American lawyer who served as the 26th chairman of the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), from 2001 to 2003. With the market debut of Coinbase via a direct listing on Nasdaq, Pitt was asked what he expects to happen with the regulation of cryptocurrencies and cryptocurrency exchanges. The former SEC chair said: I expect to see a fair amount of regulation of cryptocurrencies. Right now, I think the rules are unclear. &#8220;Whether or not certain offerings involve securities or not is unclear. There is a definite likelihood that the SEC will move forward. Gary Gensler is an expert on cryptocurrencies. He has taught about them. He is a market expert,&#8221; Pitt continued. &#8220;I would expect to see clear rules of the road evolve under his leadership.&#8221; Gensler, a crypto professor at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), was confirmed last week as the chairman of the SEC. He was sworn into office on Saturday as a member of the SEC. Pitt was also asked if the SEC should be the regulator of cryptocurrencies or whether it should be the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC), where Gensler was a former chairman. Pitt further opined: There&#8217;s a real question about where jurisdictions lie and there may be a need for clarifying legislations. The SEC has already taken the position that bitcoin and ethereum are not securities and therefore there is no regulatory involvement on the SEC&#8217;s part. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); The former chairman further explained that companies like Coinbase, &#8220;which is effectively making markets in cryptocurrencies,&#8221; are subject to SEC regulations, therefore the commission will indirectly have an influence on how these cryptocurrencies are marketed.

Government and the Fed Should Not Ignore Bitcoin GOP leader Kevin McCarthy talked about bitcoin in an interview with CNBC last week. Congressman McCarthy serves California&#8217;s 23rd district and is currently the Republican leader in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was asked specifically if he thinks that Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen and Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell have a good understanding of digital currencies or bitcoin given their recent comments and what advice he has for them. A longtime proponent of bitcoin, McCarthy said in July 2019, &#8220;I like bitcoin&#8221; and the security of the blockchain technology behind it.

Powell said last week that cryptocurrencies are &#8220;vehicles for speculation.&#8221; He claimed that &#8220;They&#8217;re not really being actively used as payment,&#8221; despite a growing list of companies accepting them for payment, including Elon Musk&#8217;s Tesla. Treasury Secretary Yellen shares a similar sentiment. She called bitcoin was a “highly speculative asset&#8221; in February, asserting that it was not “widely used as a transmission mechanism” and was an “extremely inefficient way of conducting transactions.” Yellen also warned that the misuse of cryptocurrencies is a growing problem, noting that cryptocurrencies are mainly used for illicit financing. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); McCarthy additionally said during last week&#8217;s interview that regarding bitcoin and cryptocurrencies, Treasury Secretary Yellen and Fed Chair Powell &#8220;should not only learn more about it but the basis is going to continue to grow.&#8221; He further opined: This is something that those who regulate, those who are in government that make policy better start understanding what it means for the future.

In this post I will summarize the key disrupting solution that Vechain is bringing in the supply chain management field, hope you enjoy!\\n\\n# Brief introduction\\n\\nVeChain is a smart contract enabled blockchain that uses IoT technologies focusing on supply chain management, product tracking, and other business aspects related to inventory. Vechain is using transparent technology with no single point of weakness or control which is allowing for greater security, efficiency, high-speed value transfer and ease of tracking products in a given supply chain, while reducing cost through trustless automation.\\n\\n# Vechain partners and how does it work\\n\\nVechain combines smart contracts and blockchain technology with RFID (Radio Frequency Identification), NFC (Near-Field Contact), and other IoT (Internet of Things) sensors to create a platform designed for decentralized enterprise applications. VeChain involves assigning a product a unique ID and fitting it with a VeChain IoT sensor  such as an NFC chip or RFID tracker, allowing the details of any product to be collected, stored, and quickly reviewed. This crypto-space solution will enable businesses and individuals to track items through the whole supply chain, thus verifying the authenticity of goods and combat counterfeiting. The technology is already in use in several industries like healthcare, fashion, consulting and many others, just to have a quick overview here is a screenshot from their official website:\\n\\n[VeChain partners](https://preview.redd.it/bsc41w85dtt61.jpg?width=1190&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=1e2df75360537900138b43de2fd20123ff96db19)\\n\\nThe Vechain blockchain mainly has two tokens which are:\\n\\n* VET is the token used as a unit of exchange for all transactions. VET holders automatically generate a small amount of passive income in VTHO, while 70% of the VTHO used in a VET payment is destroyed.   The VeChain tokens are required to perform all services on the VeChain platform.\\n* VTHO provides fee payments and thus functions as a “gas token,” similar to how gas functions for Ethereum (ETH) transactions.\\n\\nVTHO is generated based on VET holdings, while VET itself has a maximum fixed supply of 86,712,634,466 tokens.\\n\\nVeChain (VET) is a proof-of-stake token having low computing power requirements to achieve network security, but also there is no need for communication between nodes to reach an agreement or network consensus.

This is tilting interest rate differentials in the dollar's favor and clobbering rate-sensitive currencies on a global basis,\" he added.\nFollowing the Fed's statement on Wednesday, the benchmark 10-year yield retreated from a 13-month high of 1.69% hit early on Wednesday. On Thursday, yield on the 10 year bond resumed its recent rally to hit a fresh 13-month peak of 1.754%.

In spite of the softer inflation and particularly disappointing economic data through the week, labor market conditions remain solid, which gives continued hope of a soft landing in the property market. The proof will be in the pudding, with this year’s home buying season likely to be considered a true litmus test of sentiment towards the economic outlook.\nEconomic data released through the week included January inflation figures, December retail sales numbers, and the weekly jobless claims figures. Particularly disappointing retail sales figures were of greatest concern. While January inflation figures were mixed, expectations of softer inflation also weighed, with the annual rate of core inflation having held steady at 2.2% at the start of the year.\nOutside of the stats, more dovish central bank commentary, concerns over trade talks between the U.S and China and Brexit provided further support U.S Treasuries in the week.\nThe weekly average rates for new mortgages as of 14thFebruary were quoted byFreddie Macto be:\n• 30-year fixed rates fell by 4pp to 4.37% in the week. Rates were down from 4.38% from a year ago.

The decline comes off the back of the previous week’s 2.5% fall.\nThe Refinance Index fell by 0.1% in the week ending 8thFebruary. The rise follows a 0.3% increase from the previous week.\nThe share of refinance mortgages increased from 41.6% to 43.2%. The increase reversed the previous week’s decrease from 42.0% to 41.6%.\nAccording to the MBA, renewed uncertainty about the domestic and global economy was attributed to the fall in applications that coincided with a continued decline in mortgage rates.

One hurdle could be the release of the FOMC meeting minutes on Wednesday, which could peg back yields mid-week ahead of Thursday’s data deluge.\nWe will expect that sentiment towards the global economy and U.S – China trade talks to ultimately have the last say on U.S Treasury yields.

Although the net value of the deal was only $7,100, it is a welcome step. Gradually, more countries will recognize the advantage of using cryptocurrencies for cross-border deals.Digital asset management fund Grayscale Investments said that its institutional clients are increasingly using the current low crypto prices to make long-term investments. These inflows are largely being parked in the fund’s Bitcoin Investment Trust.A survey of 71 global institutional investors, conducted by market research company PollRight for the Global Blockchain Business Council (GBBC), has shown that 19 percent of the respondents believe that cryptocurrencies will be regularly invested in and traded by 2021.Moreover, 41 percent of the respondents said that institutional investors will enter the ICO market in the next five years.These developments confirm the growing interest of institutional investors in the crypto space. Are the top performing cryptocurrencies showing signs of bottoming out? Let’s analyze the long-term charts and try to ascertain whether they are a buy or not.DASH/USDThe expense management app Spend.com added support for Dash, offering the users various new features.The Dash Core Group has announced the launch of a new Dash Ventures entity, registered in the Cayman Islands. It will invest in various asset classes, reinvesting the profits back into the Dash ecosystem.So, is it the right time to buy the cryptocurrency? Let’s see what the charts are suggesting.The DASH/USD pair is attempting to rise from the level of $64. Although the upward move has been sluggish, one positive thing is that the cryptocurrency is consistently gaining ground.The current recovery will face resistance at $103.261, and above it at the 20-week EMA at $109. Above these levels, the pair won’t meet major resistances until it reaches $175. Therefore, the traders can buy if the price sustains above $110.Conversely, if the price turns around from the overhead resistance, a few more weeks of consolidation will be probable.A break of $64 will be a negative development as it can sink the pair to $56.214. If this level breaks, the downtrend will resume. Currently, with both of the moving averages sloping down and the RSI in the negative zone, the bears appear to have an advantage.NEO/USDThis week, NEO was the second-best performer among the top 15 cryptocurrencies by market capitalization. Although the cryptocurrency did not make any major headlines, the market participants are excited about the possible announcements during the NEO DEVCON 2019 which is taking place on Feb. 16 and 17. \\xa0The NEO/USD pair has largely been stuck in a tight range of $5.4808–$10 recently. Previously, the cryptocurrency was stuck in a range for 13 weeks, from mid-August to mid-November 2018, before a breakdown happened.The current range-bound action is already 12 weeks old. So, if history repeats itself, we are likely to see either a breakout or a breakdown within the next couple of weeks.The range this time is tight, so we expect the breakout to be strong. On the upside, a breakout and close above $10 will signal strength and can carry the cryptocurrency to $17.7. If that resistance is crossed, the rally can extend to $25.29.The traders can stay on the long side of the trade, following the break out of the range. There is a minor resistance at the 20-week EMA, but we expect it to be crossed.Conversely, if the bears sink the price below the support of the range at $5.4808, the downtrend will continue.BNB/USDBinance CFO Wei Zhou has said that the exchange remains profitable despite the prolonged bear market. CEO Changpeng Zhao has revealed that Binance is aiming to release a testnet version of its new decentralized exchange on Feb. 20.Can Binance Coin (BNB) keep outperforming the market, or is it nearing a major supply zone? Let’s find out.The BNB/USD pair is at the critical overhead resistance zone of $10–$12. This zone has proven to be a major hurdle from mid-August to early November 2018, before a breakdown happened.Both of the moving averages are flat, and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This points to a probable consolidation. If the price turns down from the current levels, it can find support at $6, and below that at $5.5.At the current levels, we couldn’t find any trades that would offer us a good risk to reward ratio, so we suggest traders wait for a small dip to enter long positions.However, if the bulls scale the overhead resistance zone, a rally to $18 will ensue. Short-term traders can buy following a break out of $12 and ride the momentum higher, but should keep a tight stop loss.EOS/USDEOS is attempting to make a comeback. However, can the recovery continue or will the bulls take a breather and give up some of the recent gains?The bulls are attempting to break out of the resistance of the tight range between $2.1733 and $3.2081. If successful, the EOS/USD pair can move up to $3.8723. Although the 20-week EMA is at $3.613, we expect it to be crossed.The pair will indicate strength after it sustains above $3.8723. That will confirm that the markets have rejected the lower levels. Thereafter, the traders can expect the rally to gradually carry the digital currency to $6.8299 over the medium term.We suggest the medium term investors wait for the price to scale above $3.8723 before initiating any long positions.On the other hand, if the bulls fail to break out of the overhead resistance, the price will extend its stay inside the range. A break below the bottom of the range at $2.1733 will indicate weakness and can result in a retest of the yearly low at $1.55. A breakdown to new yearly lows will resume the downtrend.ETH/USDThe average daily Ethereum (ETH) block rewards have dropped from over 20,000 in December 2018 to 13,370 on Feb. 10. The drop has happened due to the sudden increase in Ethereum’s mining difficulty.On Feb. 25, Nasdaq will launch its Bitcoin Liquid Index (BLX) and Ethereum Liquid Index (ELX) to track the respective cryptocurrencies’ prices. The Enterprise Ethereum Alliance (EEA) will launch a token task force, focusing on “support for fungible ERC-20 and non-fungible, ERC-721 tokens.”Is the cryptocurrency on a path to recovery?The ETH/USD pair is attempting to form a higher low at $102.49. If the bulls succeed in keeping the price above this level, an attempt to break out of the overhead resistance at $167.2 will be probable. If the price sustains above $167.2, it will indicate the start of a new uptrend.Hence, the investors can wait for a close (UTC time frame) above $167.2 to buy. The target levels to watch on the upside are $225, and above it $242.62.Our bullish view will be invalidated if the bulls fail to break out of the overhead resistance. In such a case, the digital currency will continue to trade between $102.49 and $167.2. Any break below $102.49 will be a negative development that can sink the pair to $83. If this level breaks down, the downtrend will resume.\\n'], [23241, 'hodlers-digest-february-1117-top-stories-price-movements-quotes-and-fud-of-the-week', 3665, 'Hodler’s Digest, Feb. 11–17: Top Stories, Price Movements, Quotes and FUD of the Week', '2019-02-17 17:40:00', 'Fundstrat Global Advisors thinks that crypto prices can see higher price points, and JPMorgan plans to launch its own coin.', 'Top Stories This WeekFundstrat Global Advisors Expects 2019 to Bring More Institutional Investors to CryptoAccording to a report on the 2019 crypto outlook released by New York-based research company Fundstrat Global Advisors, incremental improvements in the crypto space can provide support for higher prices for cryptocurrencies.

Also Read:&#xA0;More Than 30% of BTC Traffic Stems from the Veriblock Project Shift Financial&#x2019;s Crypto-to-Debit Services to End This Spring Shift Card customers have received an email that explains the company has plans to close its debit card operations this spring. According to the email, the company will temporarily shut down on April 11, 2019, but the firm hopes to relaunch again. The Shift Card launched in the fourth quarter of 2015, allowing people to spend cryptocurrencies tethered to their Coinbase account on the go wherever Visa is accepted. Shift Card has emailed customers letting them know the card program will be sunsetting for an unknown period of time. Unlike the Atlanta based Bitpay Card, which essentially allows people to sell BTC and BCH for loaded U.S. dollars, the Shift Card deducts the funds directly from the Coinbase user&#x2019;s account based on the spot price of the cryptocurrency in real time. The service existed for four years, but now users will have less than two months to use the Visa card before operations go on hiatus. &#x201C;We hope you enjoyed using the Shift Card and truly thank you for your loyalty,&#x201D; runs the email from Shift Financial. &#x201C;We, unfortunately, will be retiring the program in April of this year &#x2014; All Shift Cards will officially be deactivated on April 11, 2019.&#x201D; The email continues: Don&#x2019;t worry, your Shift Card will continue to work until that date. Feel free to email Shift support if you have any questions we&#x2019;d be happy to answer &#x2014; We hope to re-launch the program and issue new cards in the near future. Thank you for your patience. Little Choice Left for US Residents Seeking a Reliable Crypto Debit Card The email doesn&#x2019;t give any details as to why the crypto card service program is coming to an end. News.Bitcoin.com reached out to Shift support but has yet to receive a reply concerning the matter. Shift was partnered with Metropolitan Commercial Bank, a financial provider known for its partnerships with other cryptocurrency service providers. The move leaves the U.S. Shift customers in 46 states with only one reliable option, the Bitpay Visa card. Although there are other lesser known card operations in the works, none of them are worth discussing because some of the projects lack a physical card right now and others haven&#x2019;t been around long enough to be&#xA0;reviewed. U.S. residents have very little options for crypto-to-debit cards. Other well-known cryptocurrency debit card service providers like Wirex, Uquid, Cryptopay, and Spectrocoin only cover the EU region and various non-U.S. countries. Customers from Europe have also had issues with crypto card operators in the past when Wavecrest Holdings, another known crypto banking provider,&#xA0;stopped offering crypto-to-debit services to EU residents. Some card operations have never returned while other companies quickly found replacement banking partners. What do you think about the Shift Card ending its service this April?

With the shift from HODL to BUIDL, we are finding it easier to identify and collaborate with the teams that both have the necessary dev chops and are committed to compliance. We are extremely lucky to have a team with diverse legal skills and deep understanding of the ecosystem that enables us to deliver informed, multidisciplinary advice for our clients. We speak our clients&#x2019; language and now accept payment in their preferred currency.&#x201D; What do you think about law firms accepting bitcoin payments?

More than a quarter of BTC&#x2019;s&#xA0;transaction numbers stem from the Veriblock system and the project has been criticized for using the blockchain in this manner. Also Read:&#xA0;Orca Pool Mining Operation Aims to Defend Altcoins and Forks From Attacks The Veriblock Chain Is Paying for a Lot of BTC Block Space Most people are unaware that about a quarter of the BTC chain&#x2019;s daily transactions are due to another project called Veriblock. The Veriblock chain utilizes a system called proof-of-proof (PoP) and the &#x2018;proof&#x2019; stems from the security of the BTC chain. Essentially, Veriblock aims to provide alternative blockchain security by immersing a snapshot of the altcoin&#x2019;s ledger into the BTC chain. Veriblock uses OP return transactions and other methods to embed the blockchain&#x2019;s state data in an &#x201C;SP blockchain transaction.&#x201D; Last month BTC developer and Casa CTO Jameson Lopp noticed that Veriblock was dominating the number of BTC-based OP return transactions. &#x201C;Source of the now-highest volume of OP_RETURN outputs has been identified as Veriblock &#x201C;proof of proof&#x201D; miners,&#x201D; explained Lopp. &#x201C;They are creating around 20% of all BTC transactions now.&#x201D; Jameson Lopp noticed the Veriblock transactions last December. According to statistics published this week, Veriblock captures more than&#xA0;30-45 percent of transactions on a good day. The project is still in testnet mode and has only recently caught the attention of cryptocurrency enthusiasts. A few other BTC community members have called the project &#x201C;garbage&#x201D; and complained about Veriblock spamming the network. As usual, there are various subjective valuations on whether or not some transaction use cases are spam. Most people understand, though, that the network is permissionless by nature and it really doesn&#x2019;t matter as long as users pay for the block space. Veriblock believes other blockchains will be enticed by the PoP system because it gives them the ability to leverage BTC&#x2019;s security and reputation. &#x201C;As a result, the reinforced security provided by PoP will encourage further adoption of these alternative blockchains,&#x201D; Veriblock&#x2019;s website details. &#x201C;The transition of transactions from Bitcoin to alternative blockchains will also facilitate Bitcoin scaling, while continuing to drive value back to Bitcoin miners.&#x201D; Veriblock testnet statistics.

With the convenience provided by the network, they can enjoy the happiness of others without walking out of their room.\nIn the crypto world, there is also an emerging group of \"Cloud Miners\". While the old miners are busy for purchasing rocket-high-price mine machines and the high-performance servers, mining by consuming a large amount of electric power and earning the few token rewards by contributing the mere TPS as the node of projects, the \"Cloud Miners\" have already started cloud mining and Staking, to break the door of the traditional mining world.\nWhat is Staking and how to participate?\nBriefly speaking, Staking is proof of staking---It gains earnings by pledge the tokens of your own via proof of right. What is different is that the dividend earners do not have to purchase the dear network server, set complex mining programs, pack trading information, maintain the normal operation of the network, or participate in community governance like the miners in the past time. What they just have to do is simply to deposit the token or coin to the designated exchange, wallet or PoS pool. With time goes by, the token deposited will generate interest (usually the interest is the same as the token deposited).\nIn other words, it is more likely that you deposit your money into a bank, and the bank will pay you the interest after a period of time. If we put aside the variation of the exchange rate, you are earning the money without any loss.\nSince PoS became popular with EOS being the supernode, there are a large number of projects supporting PoS now like Suter, DOS, SERO, etc. some even with an estimated annualized rate as high as 50%. Staking has become an irrevocable trend in the cryptocurrency market.\nTo some extent, the scale and coverage of cloud computation power and online PoS have greatly surpassed the expectations for the small and delicate mining fields. Their influence is already closed to those Internet magnates of great scale. With competition intensifying, the factors of fundraising scale and speed & quality of block generation has become as important as the sight of investment and the judgment of details; building a profitable cloud mining system has become as important as the success of the project.\nCurrently, we can join PoS via the following ways:\n1) PoS Pool of Exchanges\nAs one of the world's leading blockchain companies, MXC Exchange has long been established by its PoS businesses. There are two kinds of PoS on MXC PoS Pool, one of them is the Savings. Users who have the position of the token supported by the Savings, like PCX, BHD or VSYS, are able to join it and gain dividends with an estimated annualized interest rate from 66.66% to 1.88%. There is no lock for Savings, so users can trade or withdrawal at any time.\nThe other kind is the PoS Stakings. The tokens in Stakings will be locked for a certain period of time, but its interest rate is usually higher than Savings. For example, the annualized interest rate of SUTER is as high as 50%, nevertheless, it has a relatively longer locking period-locking at least for 30 days.\nHowever, there are also tokens with a high-interest rate but a short locking period. For example, DOS has an annualized interest rate of 48% with a minimum locking period of only 5 days. Users can diversify their investment by joining these high yields but lower risk programs.\n2) HashQuark\nHashQuark is a mining pool focusing on the public chain of PoS, DPoS, and other consensus mechanisms. It has a professional background and rich experience. In addition to Cosmos, HashQuark has become the creation node and supernode of many public chains including IRISnet, Cybex, CyberMiles, V-SYSTEMS, VeChain, etc. and users of imToken have the opportunity to obtain higher and stable Staking income.\nThere are many PoS validators on the market, but HashQuark is first-class in terms of security risk control and team background.\nTo solve the security problem, HashQuark and SlowMist, the top-notch security agency, jointly launched Cosmos's certifier defense solution. It has a complete solution for DDoS attacks, node intrusions, software and hardware crash, and leakage of node-related keys. Besides, HashQuark adheres to the traditional bank-level internal risk control standards by setting up dedicated network lines to ensure security.\nIt is worth mentioning that HashQuark was funded and established by Hong Kong Fintech company HashKey Group, and Xiao Feng, chairman of HashQuark, is also the chairman of HashKey Group.\n3) Cobo Wallet\nThe Cobo wallet was founded by Shenyu. The reason why it stands out among a large number of wallets, on the one hand, is based on its good reputation in the industry, on the other, it is its unique deposit-to-gain-interest function, which is what we call PoS. At present, Such projects as DASH, VET, DCR are available on the Cobo wallet.\nIn the words of Shenyu: \"The wallet is a pure technology investment and there are no ways for profit. Besides, there are a lot of asset security issues.\" But when it combines with PoS Staking, a business logic that has never been imagined has formed.\nIn addition, there are a large number of cloud PoW miners in the industry who are rushing to the mining industry day and night.\nCloud Computing Power is Becoming a Trend\nIn the initial stage of Bitcoin mining, personal computers were able to mine. It was the era of \"everyone mining\". However, with the development of the industry, the scattered miners shifted and converged into mining pools which gathered distributed computing power. Mining has become professional and large-scale industrial entities, and the threshold for personal mining is becoming increasingly high.\nCompared to PoS staking, PoW cloud mining has actually sprung up as early as 2013, and its business logic is relatively complete. In the entire cloud computing power ecosystem, there are chip manufacturers and mining machine manufacturers in the upstream, mines and mining pools in the midstream, and miners in the downstream. The mining machine manufacturer sells the mining machine to the miners, and the coins mined by the miners are sold in the secondary market. This relatively primitive operation method may be the only few self-consistent business models other than an exchange.\nWith the gradual scale of PoW mining, intensive large computing power will become more and more common, and an individual miner will become virtually very hard to survive. Cloud computing products, however, provide an effective way to lower the threshold of the mining industry.\nThis will allow more people to share the results of the mining industry's growth, and at the same time allow a wider user group to participate in this industry, and further implement the spirit of the blockchain.\nNowadays, both PoS and PoW mining has entered the era of scale and intensiveness. Some merchants are laying large-scale mines in areas with low electricity costs (even setting up small power stations themselves). With a scale economy, the price of the mining machine is lower. Besides, the merchants choose to build the machines at well-designed rooms in areas of the best geographical and temperature advantages to improve energy efficiency. Though these measures, the revenue of users is greatly improved.\nCloud computing power helps mining companies access online traffic and industry resources such as mines and mining pools. They obtain profit by leasing computing power to users. These are the \"cloud players\" in the blockchain industry.\nIf mining can become a booster for the industry, its impact on the entire industry is undoubtedly huge. In addition to policy bottlenecks, the number of participants is also an important aspect that hinders the development of the industry. Perhaps the mining industry can attract more people to enter the blockchain industry through tangible benefits.\nContact information\nName: Jed LiCompany Name: MXC PRO FOUNDATION LTDEmail:business@mxc.comWebsite:www.mxc.com\nSOURCE:MXC PRO FOUNDATION LTD\nView source version on accesswire.com:https://www.accesswire.com/571465/MXC-launched-PoS-pool-more-Cloud-Miners-work-on-MXC-Exchange || NEW YORK, NY / ACCESSWIRE / December 27, 2019 / With the development of network technology and the richness of network products, a new group of the netizen is emerging-they are called \"Cloud Players\".

Partially reversing a 3.66% slide from Monday, Bitcoin ended the day at $8,830.0.\nA relatively range-bound morning saw Bitcoin rise from an early morning low $8,722.3 to a mid-morning high $8,795.7 ahead of a choppy afternoon.\nSteering clear of the major support and resistance levels early on, Bitcoin rallied to a midday intraday high $8,910.0.\nFalling short of the first major resistance level at $9,025.3, Bitcoin slid to a mid-afternoon intraday low $8,602.0.\nHolding above the first major resistance level at $8,533.3, Bitcoin moved back through to $8,800 levels to deliver the upside on the day.\nFor the bulls, the extended bullish trend remained intact in spite of failing to break back through the 38.2% FIB of $9,734. Bitcoin has continued to hold above the 62% FIB of 7,245.\nAcross the rest of the top 10 cryptos, it was another mixed day for the majors on Tuesday.\nStellar’s Lumen hit reverse, following its trend-bucking gain on Monday, sliding by 4.10%.\nLitecoin and Ripple’s XRP also saw red, with the pair falling by 0.55% and by 0.79% respectively.\nIt was positive for the rest of the pack, however, which joined Bitcoin in the green.\nBinance Coin led the way, rallying by 4.38%, with Tron’s TRX up by 2.73%.\nBitcoin Cash ABC (+1.35%), Bitcoin Cash SV (+0.31%), EOS (+1.15%), and Ethereum (+1.26%) saw more modest gains.\nThrough the start of the week, the total crypto market cap fell from a current week high $246.9bn to a current week low $237.75bn on Monday. On Tuesday, the market cap fell back from $240bn levels to a day low $237.9bn  before recovering. At the time of writing, the total market cap stood at $239.99bn.\nBitcoin’s dominance continued to hold at 66% levels on the day, supported by Tuesday’s partial recovery. 24-hour trading volumes continued to sit at sub-$70bn levels.\nAt the time of writing, Bitcoin was down by 0.78% to $8,761.4. A bearish start to the day saw Bitcoin fall from an early morning high $8,849.9 to a low $8,761.3.\nBitcoin left the major support and resistance levels untested early on.\nElsewhere, it was red across the crypto board. Binance Coin and Bitcoin Cash ABC were down by 1.65% and by 1.39% to lead the reversal.\nRipple’s XRP and Ethereum were down by 0.09% and by 0.73% to lead the majors early on.\nBitcoin would need to move through to $8,780 levels to support a run at the first major resistance level at $8,959.33.\nSupport from the broader market would be needed, however, for Bitcoin to break through Tuesday’s high $8,910.\nBarring a broad-based crypto rebound, Bitcoin would likely come up short of $9,000 levels for a 2ndconsecutive day.\nIn the event of a crypto rally later in the day, the second major resistance level at $9,088.67 would likely cap any upside.\nFailure to move through to $8,780 levels could see Bitcoin slide deeper into the red.\nA fall back to sub-$8,700 levels would bring the first major support level at $8,651.33 into play before any recovery.\nBarring a crypto meltdown, however, Bitcoin should continue to steer clear of sub-$8,600 levels.\nThisarticlewas originally posted on FX Empire\n• US Stock Market Overview – Stocks Close Higher, Driven by Healthcare, Trump Fails to Deliver\n• Crude Oil Price Update – Inside Retracement Zone; Strengthens Over $57.36, Weakens Under $56.08\n• E-mini Dow Jones Industrial Average (YM) Futures Technical Analysis – Vulnerable to Steep Sell-off Under 27495 Gann Angle\n• Bitcoin Cash – ABC, Litecoin and Ripple Daily Analysis – 13/11/19\n• European Equities: FED Chair Powell, Geopolitics and Stats in Focus\n• UK and U.S Inflation and FED Chair Powell Put the GBP and USD in Focus\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":6992.59,\"take_profit\":7587.58,\"forecast_10d\":[7422.65, 7293.00, 7193.60, 7200.17, 6985.47, 7344.88, 7410.66, 7411.32, 7769.22, 8163.69]}"}

Ether was recently trading at $1,365, up 3.89% from 24 hours earlier and about where it has stood for weeks. Investors remain nervous about inflation and macroeconomic uncertainty that threatens to cast the global economy into a steep recession.\nIt's generally green across the board as Asia's trading week begins with major altcoins and exchange tokens in the green over the last 24 hours.\nMeme coins and metaverse majors were the outliers, with Terra's LUNA down 1.1% and dogecoin knockoff SHIB down 0.5%. Decentraland's MANA token opened the week down 0.9% as theplatform struggles with a userbase that's not proportional to its market cap.\nThe CoinDesk Market Index (CMI), a broad-based market index that measures the performance of a basket of cryptocurrencies, recently rose 0.6%.\nEquity markets closed last week with a rare upswing, with the tech-focused Nasdaq and S&P 500 rising 2.3%, respectively on Friday, and the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) climbing 2.4% amid better-than-expected third-quarter earnings from a number of global brands, and despite a declining yen and ongoing political turmoil in the U.K.\nBrent crude oil, a measure of energy markets, ticked up slightly to trade over $93 per barrel, up more than 15% from the start of the year. Safe-haven gold climbed 1.6% to trade at $1,654 per ounce.\nThe U.S. Federal Reserve's next rate hike – a widely expected 75 basis points – is still two weeks away. But on Tuesday, the Conference Board will release October's consumer confidence index – showing a likely decline. The University of Michigan's sentiment index, a measure of attitudes about the U.S. economy, arrives on Friday. During the middle of the week, investors will be able to scrutinize housing starts and durable goods orders.\nThis rebound will face a test this week as nearly one-third of listed companies in the S&P 500 will announce earnings. If the U.S. really is at the beginning of a recession, missed earnings will be an early warning sign, and knock the wind out of this rebound.\n[{\"Asset\": \"Solana\", \"Ticker\": \"SOL\", \"Returns\": \"+2.3%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Smart Contract Platform\"}, {\"Asset\": \"Chainlink\", \"Ticker\": \"LINK\", \"Returns\": \"+1.8%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Computing\"}, {\"Asset\": \"Polygon\", \"Ticker\": \"MATIC\", \"Returns\": \"+1.1%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Smart Contract Platform\"}]\n[{\"Asset\": \"Terra\", \"Ticker\": \"LUNA\", \"Returns\": \"\\u22121.1%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Smart Contract Platform\"}, {\"Asset\": \"Decentraland\", \"Ticker\": \"MANA\", \"Returns\": \"\\u22120.9%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Entertainment\"}, {\"Asset\": \"Shiba Inu\", \"Ticker\": \"SHIB\", \"Returns\": \"\\u22120.5%\", \"DACS Sector\": \"Currency\"}]\n`\nAmerica's Supranational Mandate\nBy Sam Reynolds\nEverything’s bigger in Texas, the idiom goes. But can Texas securities law rule the world? Or can other U.S. states reach long arms into foreign jurisdictions?\nOfficials from securities regulators in Alabama, Kentucky, New Jersey and Texas are targeting thegambling-themed non-fungible token projectSlotie, with accusations that it illegally sold tokens to raise capital.\nSlotie is registered in the former Soviet republic of Georgia.\nWhile there are a number of successful online crypto casinos with active player bases, NFT casino projects — which promise a cut of gambling revenue — have so far not really gone anywhere. TheSands Vegas Casino Clubpivoted from being a metaverse-style 3D casino to a more traditional online betting operation, using existing online casino infrastructure on the backend.\nBut this is crypto. Scams and misrepresentations abound. Do your own research.\nWhat’s more concerning is how state regulators are following in the footsteps of the federal government and doing a supranational flex to exert authority over projects that have no material ties to the U.S.\nThese projects do not actively solicit U.S. residents. Nor are they based in the country, and their staff are foreign nationals. Terraform Labs will be making similar arguments in its court battle with the Securities and Exchange Commission, thatprior case lawfound in Royalty Network Inc. v.Dishant.commeans there wasn’t “purposeful availment” of the U.S. market just because the webpage was available there and the content is in English.\n(This is separate from Terraform’s case, which it lost, against the SEC that service of Do Kwon, while he was in New York, was valid.)\nYou can’t say supranational or extraterritorial authority of U.S. regulators without mentioning BitMEX. The exchange, run by Arthur Hayes, a loquacious executive who liked to taunt authority, was charged in 2020 with facilitating unregistered trading, and its top brass was separately charged with violating the Bank Secrecy Act.\nNeither the exchange nor its people had a presence in the U.S. The exchange didn’t deal with fiat currency, only bitcoin (it now takes stablecoins). No bank accounts to be examined for violations of the Bank Secrecy Act.\nEventually, none of this was tested in court becauseBitMEX settled the case, and Hayespleaded guilty. The ability for American regulators to enforce their laws globally was never examined.\nSo if the feds have shaky authority that’s yet to be properly examined over regulating international crypto projects, how is it that the states think they can do the same? Everyone knows subnational units like a state or a province generally don’t get involved in international affairs, as it's without question the domain of the federal government.\nIn previousorders, the Texas state securities board has said that metaverse casinos, like the Flamingo Casino Club, are soliciting residents of the U.S. But there’s no specific language on any of these platform’s sites targeting Texans or Americans in general. It’s also not clear that U.S. residents, or even residents of the prosecuting states, make up the majority of the purchasers of these NFTs.\nThere may be a case to be made for allegations of fraud and deceit, but why is it that state regulators think they have the authority to make it?\n8:30 a.m. HKT/SGT(12:30 a.m. UTC)The Chicago Fed National Activity Index (Sept)\n9:45 a.m. HKT/SGT(1:45 a.m. UTC)The S&P Global US Composite PMI (Oct)\n4:00 a.m. HKT/SGT(8:00 p.m. UTC)European Central Bank Lending Survey\nIn case you missed it, here is the most recent episode of\"First Mover\"onCoinDesk TV:\nBitcoin Struggles to Retain $19K; Was Do Kwon Seen in Dubai?\nTerra's Do Kwon, a fugitive wanted by South Korean authorities, reportedly left Singapore for Dubai on his way to an unknown destination.

New IRS Instructions for Tax Form 1040 The Internal Revenue Service (IRS) released its 2022 draft instructions for tax form 1040 last week. Form 1040 is the tax form used for filing individual income tax returns in the U.S. The new instructions contain several changes relating to cryptocurrency. The section titled &#8220;Virtual Currency&#8221; has been replaced with one titled &#8220;Digital Assets.&#8221; The IRS detailed: Digital assets are any digital representations of value that are recorded on a cryptographically secured distributed ledger or any similar technology. For example, digital assets include non-fungible tokens (NFTs) and virtual currencies, such as cryptocurrencies and stablecoins. In contrast, NFTs and stablecoins were not mentioned in the 2021 instructions for tax form 1040.

Also find it stran...\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nIt’s the year 2030 and sex work in the metaverse is booming. Digital users are leaning into their sexuality and exploring IRL (in real life) fantasies on an endlessly expanding menu of virtual experiences. Developers all over the world are making a decent (and at times opulent) living meeting demand for the technology, and platforms are looking the other way as long as it means more users and total value locked (TVL).\nFlash back to 2022: The sex work industry is just starting to dip its toes into the blockchain, and the writing is already on the wall. Emerging tech is enabling creativity and innovation across industries, and it would be naive to assume those forces won’t eventually bring “the oldest profession” into a cypherpunkian utopia in some truly unique ways.\nJames Key is the CEO ofAutonomy Network, a decentralized automation protocol designed for Web3 builders. This piece is part of CoinDesk'sSin Week.\nAfter all, the adult entertainment industry has been an early adopter of new technologies. If the metaverse is meant to reflect people’s wildest fantasies, then sexual exploration will definitely be a part of the scene, aswe’re already seeing in virtual dating.\nWhat would a Web3 take on OnlyFans look like if anyone could create a sex worker avatar? What’s stopping someone from opening up a sex club in the metaverse? Can anyone date a digital version of a celebrity without their consent? After all, Lebron James and Ariana Grande are currently playable aslicensed skins on Fortnite, but my guess is they aren’t clamoring to get their likeness on the “casual encounters” corner of an adults-only metaverse.\nWhile the specific answers to these questions remain to be seen, there are certainly some ambitious developers working on some version of all these things at this very moment.\nWhat is presently clear is that the business of sex relies on facilitating personal intimacy and privacy. No other industry places such a large premium on it. This presents a compelling use case for blockchain technology, both for back-end security processes and, perhaps more interestingly,NSFWmetaversal encounters. One of Web3’s biggest value propositions is its ability to simultaneously enhance users’ privacy and online verifiability.\nLet’s talk about the power of data in the context of personal preference and privacy. For instance, the physical appearance of the female robot inthe 2014 movie “Deus Ex Machina”was based on the protagonist’s porn search history, which comes across as an invasive overreach to most watchers. We encounter similar algorithms and machine learning tools that study our behaviors to manipulate our desires every time we use proprietary software, like Google Search. This is exactly what Web3 aims to disrupt.\nIt would be entirely possible to encrypt data reflecting someone’s sexual preferences into an on-chain avatar that evolves based on their changing preferences. This could be done without ever divulging any personal information or search history, in-platform or to outside parties.\nRead more:Should Crypto and Porn Get Intimate?/ Opinion\nThis avatar could then be applied to something likeVex Ruby, a virtual cam girl that engages with viewers in real time, or to create an interactiveautonomous non-fungible token (NFT)like Alice, aGPT-3-powered virtual humanthat was auctioned off at Sotheby’s for nearly half a million dollars.\nAlternatively, people’s custom sex avatars may also be discretely ported to an adult metaverse, where real-world sex workers could apply it as a skin when interacting with a client in a virtual setting secured by a privacy-enhancing blockchain network.\nAs virtual reality (VR) sexuality researcher Angelina Aleksandrovichputsit: “Sex workers can jump into any kind of avatar that the client wants to play with [in the metaverse]; they can change the world on demand and play out different scenarios that the clients want.”\nAll of which is to say, virtual reality will be key to creating many of the actual sensory experiences future sex workers and clients participate in, but blockchain technology will be key to making these experiences more individualized, accessible and secure.\nErotic encounters in the virtual realm are not beholden to the constraints of the physical world or even our own biological realities (see Viro Playspace’s“smokin’ hot dragon babe”), especially with the rise of haptic bodysuits and other sensory devices.\nPerhaps more importantly, VR can also be leveraged to help people safely experiment with their sexual identity and gender expressions. If so, it will be blockchain technology that helps ensure that participants on both sides of the market are kept safe while they explore, in terms of both physical wellbeing and desired level of anonymity.\nAfter all both sex workers and clients want better ways to vet their counterparts while protecting their own right to privacy. Decentralized, on-chain reputation systems have more potential to address this issue than any other existing technology.\nThe point of applying new technologies to existing industries is to make future products and services fundamentally better in some enduring way – not for the sake of adding new bells and whistles. In that sense, blockchain’s role in enhancing the adult entertainment industry’s discovery process and quality of engagement – while enhancing participants’ safety and control – will be an interesting story to follow, even for individuals who aren’t participating in the space.\nRead more:What Sex Workers Want to Do With Bitcoin\nBlockchain technology was founded on a socially positive ideology and the majority of serious builders within the space are working on some kind of virtual experience that encourages more high-quality connections and individual empowerment – regardless of whether they’re working on something “sexy” or not.\n\nGuidance: Decide BUY/SELL/HOLD and then output the 10-day price forecast, adhering to the strict JSON format.", "output": "{\"action\":\"BUY\",\"confidence\":95,\"stop_loss\":19204.84,\"take_profit\":19929.18,\"forecast_10d\":[20095.86, 20770.44, 20285.84, 20595.35, 20818.48, 20635.60, 20495.77, 20485.27, 20159.50, 20209.99]}"}

Bitcoin gained 0.3% to $8,598.6 by 1:44 AM ET (05:44 GMT). It reached above the $9,000 mark on Thursday. \"On a go-forward basis, bitcoin probably consolidates somewhere between $7,000 and $10,000,” Galaxy Digital CEO Mike Novogratz told Bloomberg. Meanwhile, some analysts said the sharp rebound in Bitcoin prices could soon fizzle. Peter Schiff of Euro Pacific Asset management said the crypto market has “an abundance of fake buying sentiment.” “The cryptocurrency serves neither the purpose of money nor a store of value,” Schiff said in an interview with News BTC. Bitcoin has seemingly gained the role of a safe-haven asset recently, but Schiff said eventually central banks and investors will turn back to gold because of its “historical significance as money for thousands of years.” “Central banks are buying gold; they are not buying bitcoin because gold is money,” said Schiff. “We are in the biggest bubbles that the central banks have ever blown,” he said. “And when it gets popped, the 2008 economic crisis will appear like a Sunday school picnic. Then, people will figure out why gold is important,” he added. Other cryptocurrency prices also gained today.

Casey is the chairman of CoinDesk’s advisory board and a senior advisor for blockchain research at MIT’s Digital Currency Initiative. Let’s talk about bitcoin, toxicity and inclusiveness. (Boy, my Twitter feed is going to have fun over the next few days.) So Long to the Clutter: A Cooling Crypto Market Will Bring Change We Need To start with, let me take a position: I stand with those people, especially women, who’ve lately been calling out maltreatment from members of the bitcoin community and citing rude and abusive behavior as proof of that community’s lack of inclusiveness. These are people who believe in cryptocurrency technology’s potential but feel discouraged to believe that they belong to the community’s dominant white-male subculture. If this technology is to fulfill its global potential, the community associated with it must confront this problem. But the real point of this column is not to just defend these critics. It’s to debunk one of the more common positions adopted by those who take issue with their complaints, particularly on Twitter. In doing so, I hope to emphasize just how important the concepts of “community” and “culture” are to the healthy development of crypto technology and the ecosystem growing around it. Hammer culture? The line that’s most often thrown back at those calling out incivility is that bitcoin is nothing more than a technology, a tool, and that it’s meaningless to attach to it value judgments relating to human behavior. Bitcoin is amoral, apolitical and a-cultural, the argument goes, and like any technology it is used by good and bad people alike. These pundits, warning of a political correctness-based threat to free speech, will then advise the injured party to take issue directly with the bad actors but refrain from agitating for community-wide change. University Researchers Turn to Blockchain to Preserve Cultural Heritage A perfect example of the genre came from outspoken lawyer Preston Byrne. Story continues Clever, yes. But it’s extremely unhelpful, because the examples given do not share equivalent terms of reference. Byrne’s “hammer” refers solely to the steel implement that tradesmen use. By contrast, people complaining about “bitcoin” are clearly using the word in a much wider context than in merely a reference to the code, to the ones and zeros that comprise the bitcoin protocol. They are inhe...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: [[26852, 'israeli-supreme-court-rules-in-favor-of-cryptocurrency-exchange-in-bank-dispute', 4816, 'Israeli Supreme Court Rules in Favor of Cryptocurrency Exchange in Bank Dispute', '2019-06-03 23:35:00', 'The Supreme Court of Israel says Leumi Bank cannot block Bits of Gold’s account due to regulatory concerns, setting precedent for other crypto organizations.', 'The Supreme Court of Israel has declared that Leumi Bank cannot block the cryptocurrency exchange Bits of Gold’s account on the grounds of regulatory concerns, according to a report by Finance Magnates on June 3.Despite the Supreme Court’s ruling against Leumi, the bank reportedly maintains its stance against dealing with the exchange. The report notes, however, that this ruling sets precedent for Israeli cryptocurrency firms to legally use traditional banking services in the region.In 2017, the Israeli Supreme Court previously ruled in favor of Leumi in a separate case against Bits of Gold, in which the bank restricted the exchange’s account on the grounds that bitcoin (BTC) transactions could not comply with the country’s anti-money laundering (AML) laws.In 2018, however, the Israeli Supreme Court ruled that Leumi Bank could not block account transactions on the grounds that they went to BTC exchanges, purportedly “websites that execute gambling transactions.” Further, Judge Anat Baron issued a court order temporarily barring Leumi from blocking Bits of Gold’s bank account.Judge Baron commented that since there was no indication of any AML violations over five years of exchange transactions, there are not any grounds to continue blocking Bits of Gold’s account. Baron noted, however, that the decision to issue the court order did not prevent the bank from scrutinizing the exchange’s behavior or complying with their risk management policy.In March 2019, the Israeli Securities Authority issued its final recommendations for cryptocurrency regulations. The report includes several ideas for how to support the cryptocurrency space in the country, including the establishment of a regulatory sandbox.\\n'], [26847, 'john-mcafee-to-roll-out-freedom-coin-cryptocurrency-this-fall', 12798, 'John McAfee To Roll Out ‘Freedom Coin’ Cryptocurrency This Fall', '2019-06-03 21:04:00', 'John McAfee is releasing a cryptocurrency this fall which purports to be independent from fiat currencies, crypto exchanges and traditional backing assets.', \"Crypto enthusiast, bitcoin (BTC) bull, antivirus software namesake and 2020 United States presidential campaigner John McAfee is releasing his own independent cryptocurrency, according to an official Twitter post on May 29.According to his website on the announced cryptocurrency, the “McAfee Freedom Coin” will roll out some time this fall. The McAfee Freedom Coin appears to aim for total isolation and independence from traditional currencies, assets and exchanges in an effort to reach “the Holy Grail of cryptocurrency — economic freedom.”According to McAfee, these are the desired properties of the new cryptocurrency:“What is needed is a coin disconnected from fiat currencies and from other crypto currencies alike — a coin with zero cash-in value, yet accepted universally … It is not based on any commodity nor is it connected to the value or behavior of any external item or entity. The value of the coin will always be zero in relation to any other currency yet it's natural market value is free, completely, to grow.”As previously reported on Cointelegraph, McAfee has said he plans to run for President of the United States in 2020 on a boat in international waters, since he has purportedly been indicted by the U.S. Internal Revenue Service (IRS).McAfee has reportedly made no secret of his tax evasion, saying that he has not filed taxes for eight years. His presidential campaign is also not a serious bid for the office, but rather a stated attempt to promote cryptocurrencies as a means to securing personal freedom for citizens.In recent news, McAfee said that he has discovered the identity of the mysterious Bitcoin creator Satoshi Nakamoto, who is purportedly a man living in the U.S. McAfee apparently was planning to out Nakamoto’s identity, but has put his plan on pause per advice from his extradition lawyer:“The US extradition request to the Bahamas \\xa0is imminent. I met with Mario Gray, my extradition lawyer, and it is now clear ... that releasing the identity of Satoshi at this time could influence the trial and risk my extradition. I cannot risk that.

Venture capitalist Jason Calacanis believes that Bitcoin will plunge as it will be replaced by a new technology. On similar lines, research firm Gartner believes that the current blockchain technology being used by enterprises may have to be replaced within the next 18 months.BTC/USDBitcoin (BTC) is finding strong support closer to the 20-day EMA but is facing profit booking at higher levels. This points to a range formation where the bulls buy closer to $8,000 and book profits near $9,000. Currently, both the moving averages are sloping up, which is a positive sign. But the negative divergence on the RSI indicates that the upside momentum is losing steam.If the bears sink the BTC/USD pair below the 20-day EMA and $8,000, a drop to $7,413 is probable. On the other hand, if the bulls reverse direction from the current levels and ascend $9,053.12, a rally to $10,000 is possible. We will wait for a reliable buy setup to form before suggesting a trade in it.ETH/USDEthereum (ETH) is facing a stiff resistance close to the $280 mark. On the downside, the 20-day EMA has been acting as a strong support. However, we expect one of the levels to give way soon. The indicators are giving conflicting signals. Though the uptrending moving averages indicate strength, the negative divergence on the RSI points to a correction.If the bulls scale above $280, a rally to the $300–$322 zone is probable. We anticipate the ETH/USD pair to face a stiff resistance at $322. Conversely, if the pair slips below the 20-day EMA, it can drop to $225.39, which is a critical support. If this support cracks, we can expect a deeper correction. We do not find any reliable buy setup at the current level.XRP/USDThe recovery in Ripple (XRP) seems to have hit a wall in the $0.45–$0.47919 zone. This is the third instance in which the bulls have failed to scale this resistance zone. Therefore, we suggest traders book profits on 40% of their long positions close to $0.45 and keep a stop loss of $0.35 on the rest. We will soon trail the stops higher.The moving averages are sloping up, which is a positive sign, but a failure to scale above the resistance zone is likely to attract profit booking that can drag the price back towards the 20-day EMA. If this support also breaks down, the XRP/USD pair can plunge to $0.37835. On the other hand, if the bulls push the price above the overhead resistance zone, a rally to the target objective of $0.60 will be in the cards.BCH/USDThe trend in Bitcoin Cash (BCH) is bullish as it is still trading inside the ascending channel and above its 20-day EMA. However, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI has formed a negative divergence, which suggests that momentum is waning.If the BCH/USD pair dips below the 20-day EMA, it can slide to the 50-day SMA. Contrary to our assumption, if it rebounds sharply from the 20-day EMA and breaks out of the channel, it will indicate strength. The next target to watch on the upside is $638.99. We should see a decisive large range move within the next couple of days.EOS/USDEOS is facing stiff resistance near the $9 mark. The price turned down from $8.6503 and corrected to the 20-day EMA. We expect buyers to step in and support the digital currency at the 20-day EMA and below it at $6.8299.A breakdown of $6.8299 will indicate a loss of momentum and a deeper fall to the 50-day SMA. On the contrary, if the EOS/USD pair rebounds from the support zone, it can move up to $9 and above it to $9.60. Currently, the 20-day EMA is flattening out and the RSI is just above the midpoint. This shows balance between the bulls and the bears.LTC/USDLitecoin (LTC) has been consolidating between $102.4199 and $120.1518 for the past four days. This tight range is unlikely to continue for long. We should soon see a large range breakout. It is difficult to predict the direction of the breakout because of contradictory signals from the indicators. The moving averages are sloping up, which is a positive sign.

As of right now, anyone in the world can use the service to trade bitcoin cash (BCH) securely. Since pre-launch signups were announced last month, thousands of traders have created accounts and there are over 2,200 active offers ready to go. Also read: Creating Your Own SLP-Based Token Using Memo Local.Bitcoin.com: Prepare to Trade Bitcoin Cash Peer-to-Peer The Bitcoin.com team has been busy preparing for the launch of our private, peer-to-peer trading platform for the BCH community called Local.Bitcoin.com. We believe that BCH has the means to provide every global citizen with economic freedom, helping liberate them from the confines of the current manipulated economies people are forced to live with today. In contrast to government-issued fiat, the Bitcoin Cash network is a decentralized, peer-to-peer electronic cash system that moves beyond borders and can help the world enjoy a new monetary renaissance. In honor of the 30th anniversary of the Tiananmen Square protests, Bitcoin.com decided to launch the over-the-counter BCH marketplace on June 4. CEO Roger Ver and the rest of the Bitcoin.com team are motivated by the positive ways in which widespread Bitcoin Cash use will make the world a better place. Our team announced the launch of Local.Bitcoin.com during the second week of May and since then there&#x2019;s been a ton of interest from crypto enthusiasts around the world. So far the marketplace has seen 7,680 signups, 3,118 total offers and 2,202 active offers from traders out of 3,118 created since launch. A great number of Local.Bitcoin.com signups stem from the U.S. (24.5%), Nigeria (6.1%), Indonesia (5.7%), India (5.1%), and the Philippines (4.7%). There&#x2019;s also a decent amount of accounts coming from the U.K., Canada, Zimbabwe, Venezuela, and Russia. Currently, 37.8% of traders plan on swapping with USD but there&#x2019;s a large number of trades exchanging with EUR, INR, NGN, IDR, PHP, GBP, THB, and CAD. The most popular choice of payment is bank transfer (33.4%) but the second largest payment is in-person cash trades (16%). This is followed by Paypal (14.4%), cash deposit (7.8%) and Western Union (5.7%) while gift cards (2.7%), Moneygram (2%), Skrill (1.8%), and Venmo (1.2%) follow behind. Today&#x2019;s grand opening of Local.Bitcoin.com in honor of the Tiananmen Square protests will help make bitcoin cash accessible to anyone who wants unrestricted access to a tool that fosters economic freedom. Bitcoin&#x2019;s first angel investor and the CEO of Bitcoin.com, Roger Ver, is thrilled to see all the signups and action taking place on the peer-to-peer market during the pre-launch up until the opening day. Ver ventured during the launch: Local.Bitcoin.com is a game changer for not only for cryptocurrency trading, but for global trade as well. Getting Started Signing up for Local.Bitcoin.com is easy and only takes a few minutes. If you want to get in on all the private, over-the-counter trading action happening on our BCH marketplace then go directly to the trading platform&#x2019;s signup page. Local.Bitcoin.com will ask you to create a username and password for the exchange and the system will also generate a private key offline. Everything is encrypted using AES256-CBC to a PBKDF2-stretched version of your password, ensuring that our company has no access to your Local.Bitcoin.com wallet as the entire process is completely noncustodial. After you complete the signup process, the system will send you a confirmation email so you can access your account settings and create trades. Browsing the Local.Bitcoin.com trades during the grand opening. Now that the market is open you can create offers and trades while also being able to browse the active trades currently listed. You can customize your account setting and change your username, write a blurb about yourself, edit your email address, and add a phone number as well. The account setting section will allow you to set up two-factor authentication and download your Local.Bitcoin.com wallet&#x2019;s backup. Additionally, in the settings section, you can generate a referral code in order to invite family members and friends. For every person you refer, you earn 20% of the fees for the lifetime of all the users who sign up through your unique code. Local.Bitcoin.com is a great noncustodial service that allows individuals to trade with each other freely. With Local.Bitcoin.com&#x2019;s blind escrow system no one touches your money but you and it is technically impossible for our website to spend BCH held in escrow. The escrow makes it so both parties can complete a trade on their own, unlike competitor OTC services where the escrow is held by the third party for a short period of time. Bitcoin.com can help with dispute resolution but we can only allow the funds to be spent by the buyer or seller using the opcode OP_CHECKDATASIG. This opcode is only available using the Bitcoin Cash network and it enhances the decentralization of the Local.Bitcoin.com service.

Now the bank has been forced to accept that the company&#x2019;s account will remain open indefinitely. Also Read: Community Funding and Bringing Smart Contracts to BCH in the Weekly Update From Bitcoin.com Banks Can&#x2019;t Ban Crypto Exchanges for No Reason Tel Aviv-based cryptocurrency exchange Bits of Gold can continue to have an account with Bank Leumi thanks to the intervention of the Israeli Supreme Court. The court has advised the bank to accept the appeal of the exchange against the closing of its account and the two sides reached a settlement that the judges validated as a ruling on Monday. The three supreme court judges who presided over the case also wrote that the exchange will continue its operations with &#x201C;virtual coins&#x201D; in compliance with any future regulations if and when those will be issued. The exchange told local media that &#x201C;This is a tremendous achievement for the company and the digital currency community, when the Supreme Court actually intervened and forced the bank to allow the company to manage an account whose main activity is connected to digital coins, despite the bank&#x2019;s objection in principle.&#x201D; Yuval Roash, CEO of Bits of Gold, added: &#x201C;We worked hard to set up a company that met regulatory requirements in a new industry, and that work paid off. We managed to prove to the court that we are worthy of the trust of the banking system and that the attempt to close our bank account was wrong.&#x201D; Final Chapter in Bits of Gold vs. Leumi Saga? In 2015, Bank Leumi decided to close the account of Bits of Gold, which is legally licensed as a currency changer business, only because it deals in cryptocurrency. The exchange turned to the courts and for several years kept working thanks to an injunction while awaiting a final verdict. In 2017, the Tel Aviv District Court authorized the bank to disallow Bits of Gold from trading in bitcoin, and the company appealed this decision to the Israeli Supreme Court which issued a temporary injunction. In early 2018 the Supreme Court ordered that the company can keep its account until a ruling was issued on the entire case.

As a student of Kafka, Koestler, and Solzhenitsyn, he believed that truth, creativity, love, and compassion are corrupted by institutional hierarchies, and by “patronage networks”—one of his favorite expressions—that contort the human spirit. He sketched out a manifesto of sorts, titled “Conspiracy as Governance,” which sought to apply graph theory to politics. Assange wrote that illegitimate governance was by definition conspiratorial—the product of functionaries in “collaborative secrecy, working to the detriment of a population.” He argued that, when a regime’s lines of internal communication are disrupted, the information flow among conspirators must dwindle, and that, as the flow approaches zero, the conspiracy dissolves. Leaks were an instrument of information warfare.  \\n&gt;  \\n&gt;These ideas soon evolved into WikiLeaks. In 2006, Assange barricaded himself in a house near the university and began to work. In fits of creativity, he would write out flow diagrams for the system on the walls and doors, so as not to forget them.

Australian police , however, now allege that the duos cryptocurrency business was just a front for an international drug-dealing operation. The two men are now in custody facing various charges all relating to drug-smuggling operations, according to the Daily Mail . According to the Australian police, the drugs were acquired on various darknet sites and then shipped to Australia. Their customers often paid in bitcoin, per the police. The unraveling of the drug ring started after mail packages containing cocaine, ketamine and ecstasy were intercepted by Australian Border Force at Melbourne Airport in February 2017. After eight months, the packages were traced to McBeth and an associate named Jackson Li. They were arrested and charged with importing cocaine, crystal methamphetamine and ecstasy. The police however only managed to link Karagiozis to the drug ring last month. He was subsequently arrested and charged with 14 offenses all tied to drug dealing. The Fast Growth of Auscoin McBeth and Karagiozis founded Australian Securities and Investments Commission (ASIC)-licensed Auscoin in late 2017. While the two were co-founders, Karagiozis became the face of the company in McBeths absence as the firm rolled out cryptocurrency ATMs across Australia. In December 2017 Karagiozis had set a target of 1,200 ATMs across the country. The most recent update on the number of Bitcoin ATMs installed by the firm in Australia is 30.

Promoters have promised faster securities settlement, decentralized social media, instant payments, cheaper remittances, and everything in between. And indeed, these benefits may come in time. But there’s one domain in which blockchains clearly outperform their traditional counterparts today: accounting. Blockchains track debits and credits to accounts on a ledger, just like an ordinary accounting system, but in a real-time, transparent, and immutable fashion (once transfers are settled). The existence of any asset that resides on a blockchain—whether a tokenized security, or a digital commodity like Bitcoin—is fully verifiable at any time by anyone with an internet connection. The entire supply of Bitcoin, down to the tiniest unit—one satoshi—can be verified in real time by anyone running a node. What’s more, any entity can prove mathematically to any third party that they own a digital asset via a cryptographic signature, without the need for any guarantor. This isn’t the case for traditional assets or commodities, which rely on a network of intermediaries to attest to their existence. In practice, this means financial assets end up concentrated in large custodians, like the DTC with equities, or gold with organizations like the LBMA. The high cost of auditability for conventional assets tends to have a concentrating effect. This remarkable auditability property of digital assets has enabled crypto platforms to build attestation tools enabling end users to verify that their assets are actually being held in reserve, and don’t simply exist on someone else’s ledger, subject to error or fraud. And these tools are long overdue. For as long as crypto exchanges and custodians have existed, they have let down their users with a series of spectacular failures—one crisis after the next from Mt. Gox to Bitfinex to Quadriga to FTX and, most recently, Prime Trust . Those of us who believe in the promise of digital assets are fed up with this grim status quo and have begun to demand more transparency from the exchanges we all rely on. Story continues As a result, exchanges and custodial platforms today are coalescing around a simple idea: What if these platforms could indisputably prove to users that they control funds held for users? This is known in the industry as a proof of reserve, or PoR. The concept has existed in the digital asset context for around a decade, and it has been continually refined ever since. Effectively, it involves a custodial platform providing signatures attesting to their unique ownership over some digital assets on-chain, combined with a disclosure of client liabilities. By publishing these datasets, and giving end users—and even interested onlookers—the option to actually verify that a given liability corresponds to some assets, clients can gain strong assurances that the platform is sound. Legislative initiatives both at the state and federal level have focused on asking exchanges to segregate client and operating capital, and to give clients assurances in the case of platform liquidation or bankruptcy. This is necessary, but only part of the solution. Prime Trust, which recently revealed it had lost $82 million in client assets and hid those losses for years, was a Nevada Trust company. The architecture of the Trust Charter, ironclad from a legal perspective, unfortunately did little to reveal the loss of assets. A monthly—or even higher frequency—attestation, as is the standard with PoR, would have forced divulging the loss when it first occurred, because Prime Trust would not have been able to provide valid signatures for user funds held. This would have also been the case with Mt. Gox, Quadrigra, and FTX. These were all drawn out insolvencies, concealed for months if not years. An exchange engaging in PoR attestations isn’t immune from losing customer funds or being hacked, but the PoR does reveal these losses when they occur, limiting further fallout. In the wake of FTX, PoR is now being voluntarily adopted across the industry. Many of the largest exchanges worldwide, including Kraken, Binance, Bitmex, Derebit, Kucoin, and OKX, now conduct these attestations with frequency, covering tens of billions of dollars in client assets. Lawmakers in the U.S. and abroad have begun to recognize the importance of PoR. In March, Texas passed the landmark HB1666 , which requires firms with money transmitter licenses to carry out PoRs, starting in September. At the federal level, Sens. Cynthia Lummis (R-Wyo.) and Kirsten Gillibrand (D-N.Y.) included in their reintroduced Responsible Financial Innovation Act mandatory PoR and a request for PCAOB to standardize the procedure. Since 2021, Wyoming has made reference to proof of reserve in the state's Digital Asset Custody Framework. Dubai (see Reserve Assets) and Singapore (see Regulation 16C(11)) have also made reference to similar on- and off-chain reconciliations in recent guidance. Canada has recommended since 2021 that exchanges engage in PoR as a best practice. Bermuda, which is distinguishing itself as a premier crypto-focused regulator, has maintained an explicit reference to proof of reserve in its Digital Assets Custody Code of Practice since 2019. PoR is neither new nor limited in its reach to a handful of enthusiasts. It has existed for years and has already been embraced by regulators worldwide. That doesn't mean PoR is without its critics. Sens. Elizabeth Warren (D-Mass.) and Ron Wyden (D-Ore.) have engaged in a campaign of harassment leveled at auditors who service crypto firms. They aim to stymie the crypto space by stripping it of CPA firm services, which are necessary for platforms operating in compliance with MTLs and similar regulatory regimes. In a recent letter to the PCAOB, they attacked PoR and called it a “sham audit.” The PCAOB duly released an advisory letter warning investors about PoR attestations. Frightening audit firms away from a fit-for-purpose form of assurance is the opposite of what a reasonable accounting regulator should do. For its part, the AICPA has demurred on issuing any guidance on PoR even though it's progressing on stablecoin attestation standards. This uncertainty has had the effect of leaving most CPA firms unwilling to supervise these procedures. We in the industry are pushing for more sunlight, but some lawmakers in Washington aim to leave us in the dark. The standard critiques of PoR have largely been addressed. PoR is not contemplated as a substitute for standard audit types but rather as a complement. Mindful of this, the Texas legislation blends traditional and crypto-native assurance, asking for PoRs but also for CPAs to supervise them. Specialist CPA firms have emerged with expertise in overseeing these procedures. Traditional assurance is fine, but it’s no substitute for a high-frequency proof to end users that custodians have their funds. And while early PoRs ran the risk of leaking client data, innovations—such as zero-knowledge proofs —allow PoRs to be done safely. We are not asking crypto exchanges to be held to a different standard from conventional custodians. In fact, a frequent proof-of-reserve attestation provides far more transparency than conventional custodians can offer. It’s not a substitute to standard audits but rather a more narrow complement—it enhances conventional audits. Together, the two provide a level of assurance not otherwise attainable. We ask simply that Washington stop undermining the industry’s efforts to clean itself up, recognize the validity of PoR, and facilitate its proliferation across the industry. Lawmakers should encourage the accounting standards setting bodies, like the FASB or the PCAOB, to ratify industry efforts around PoR so audit firms feel empowered to supervise them. And they should recognize the good work that custodians are already doing to make themselves more transparent and accountable. The crypto industry is working hard to gain back trust. If PoR becomes widespread and standardized, we will exceed the level of assurance that custodians can offer with traditional assets. This is a worthy goal, and one that Washington should support.

With this move, Worldcoin aims to prepare for its future launch, taking advantage of the scalability features that its deployment on Optimism brings, including migrating user accounts and bringing Uniswap support to the World App. Worldcoin Migrates Protocol to Optimism Mainnet Worldcoin, the biometric decentralized identity and wallet protocol, has announced it has completed the migration process to switch its operations from Polygon to Optimism, an Ethereum L2 scaling layer. In February, the protocol decided to migrate its World App and World ID apps to Optimism, stating it was &#8220;committed to realizing a scalable, inclusive future that unlocks the full potential of crypto and furthers the evolution of identity on the blockchain.&#8221; This migration comprehends the creation of bridges for the World ID protocol from Ethereum to Polygon and Optimism. Also, most World App users&#8217; accounts have been migrated to Optimism. The few remaining will be invited to migrate at the start of the app, a process that will take 90 seconds on average. Worldcoin already has registered more than 2 million signups, coming principally from countries like Barcelona, Berlin, Buenos Aires, New York, Seoul, and Tokyo, which have set up several Orbs, the biometric devices needed to include users by reading their irises and registering their information in the protocol. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); The Benefits for Optimism Worldcoin&#8217;s migration conforms to the new concept of &#8220;super chain&#8221; that Optimism has engineered, promoting the interoperability of several chains on top of the L2 platform, turning it into a &#8220;platform for chains.&#8221; Base, the Coinbase-built Ethereum L2 scaling layer, is also another of the projects that are being built on top of Optimism. The integration of World ID on top of Optimism will bring the advantages of this decentralized protocol to the L2 layer, allowing its core functions to include ID validation services for different purposes. For example, Worldcoin states that its ID capabilities might enhance the functionality of the Citizens House, a governance component seeking to help retroactively allocate funding to significant &#8220;public goods&#8221; of the protocol. Also, Worldcoin mentions that its integration might also help power Optimism&#8217;s Attestation Station, providing the needed ID verifications of any party to be part of the signing of any document to be kept as part of the super chain.

And litigate more.&#x201D; Mark Cuban Weighs in on SEC v. Ripple Case Shark Tank star and the owner of the NBA team Dallas Mavericks, Mark Cuban, has shared his thoughts on Twitter concerning the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case regarding XRP. Commenting on the SEC&#x2019;s filing in the lawsuit against Terraform Labs and co-founder Do Kwon, where the regulator alleged that the Ripple ruling was &#x201C;wrongly decided,&#x201D; Cuban criticized the securities watchdog for referring to &#x201C;every buyer as an investor in their filing.&#x201D; The billionaire argued: That&#x2019;s not the case and Ripple made that clear. Securities have one purpose, to be a security. For a defi or CEX buyer, it&#x2019;s impossible to know why a buyer buys. But it is possible to look at the Blockchain and see there are transactions based on the utility of the token. The Shark Tank star warned on July 14, one day after the Ripple ruling, that &#x201C;The SEC can still go after exchanges for selling tokens because they feel they regulate the exchanges.&#x201D; He described: &#x201C;Of course, there is a lot of grey in this ruling, but the SEC could have gone the route of Japan and set rules to protect investors. Instead, they choose to always litigate to regulate. Think about that approach from the perspective of a small investor or a small entrepreneur looking to start a crypto company. The SEC expects both to hire securities attorneys to provide guidance. (I know. We called them to ask them what to do for a company I&#x2019;m involved with).&#x201D; if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); Cuban opined: The only reasonable conclusion, is that the current mission of the SEC is not to protect small investors. It never has been. (See the billions of shares trading in bankrupt companies &#x2026; and in crazy pink sheet and OTC companies). Their goal is to litigate. And litigate more. And litigate more. &#x201C;All this could go away if Congress or the SEC set brightline rules,&#x201D; the Dallas Mavericks owner concluded. Earlier this month, Cuban said the SEC chose the wrong path to regulate crypto, stating that the regulator was &#x201C;arrogant in thinking that its framework covered every possible situation.&#x201D; In June, he offered suggestions on how the SEC could regulate the crypto industry. Following the Ripple ruling, several U.S. lawmakers called on Congress to pass legislation to regulate crypto. The SEC has indicated that it will appeal the Ripple ruling. SEC Chairman Gary Gensler said last week that the securities regulator is &#x201C;disappointed&#x201D; in the court ruling on retail investors but will continue to bring crypto firms into compliance. The SEC has also asked Congress for more funding in order to tackle crypto risks and wrongdoing. Do you agree with Mark Cuban?

Despite the securities regulator&#x2019;s indication to appeal the ruling, the lawyer emphasized that &#x201C;There isn&#x2019;t an immediate right to an appeal.&#x201D; He pointed out that if the case is appealed, it will take two years before a decision is issued by an appellate court. Lawyer Discusses SEC Appeal of Ripple Ruling Following the recent ruling in the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) v. Ripple case concerning XRP, speculations arise that the securities regulator might appeal the decision made by District Judge Analisa Torres. John E. Deaton, a well-known lawyer in the XRP community, has provided his analysis and insights regarding the potential outcomes of the SEC&#x2019;s appeal. An &#x201C;appeal is not even close to be a setback&#x201D; for XRP, he tweeted on Saturday, elaborating: It will be two years from now before a decision is issued by the 2nd Circuit, if it&#x2019;s appealed. The Torres Decision is the law until then. &#x201C;Even if the 2nd Circuit said Torres was wrong regarding her application of the 3rd Howey factor (which I predict they won&#x2019;t), that doesn&#x2019;t meant the SEC wins on programmatic sales (sales on exchanges),&#x201D; Deaton emphasized. &#x201C;All that happens is that Torres then applies the other two factors and could likely still rule the same exact way, concluding the SEC didn&#x2019;t satisfy the common enterprise factor &#x2013; which is a more difficult factor to meet IMO than the third factor,&#x201D; he stressed. In a follow-up tweet, the lawyer clarified: &#x201C;I&#x2019;m not suggesting that Judge Torres decision is binding within the SDNY [Southern District of New York]. A fellow district judge could disagree with her. But I think a fellow judge in the 2nd Circuit is going to be hard pressed to disagree with Judge Torres, especially considering she cited Judge Castel from Telegram.&#x201D; if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var ...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): []\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nEpazz, Inc. CHICAGO, IL, July 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via NewMediaWire – Epazz Inc. (OTC Pink: EPAZ), a mission-critical provider of drone technology, blockchain cryptocurrency mobile apps and cloud-based business software solutions, announced today that CryObo Technology would help farmers tokenize their crops through the issuance of NFT tokens in order to earn extra revenue. The recent court decision in favor of Ripple allows US Farmers to take advantage of CrybObo technology. Users of CrybObo will not need to file a registration statement for their tokens. The company will issue tokens for customers in accordance of the Court Decision. The company has been working on CryObo software which enables the tokenization of farm crops and produce. It allows farmers to raise capital immediately based on achieving future milestones and lets token holders evaluate the earned income of the token. It will enable industries to gain additional funding to spend on crop production. Tokenization of farm produce through CryObo Technology can help food security by providing farmers the additional funding to invest in improving crop and farm practices. With the help of the ZenaDrone 1000 technology, the unmanned aerial vehicle can scan the field and record the accurate and actual health of the crops so farmers can monitor and more accurately predict potential harvest yield. In addition, it will allow farmers to make potential adjustments to irrigation, fertilization, and weed control during the growing season. The NFT Tokens expand the market, and provide the opportunity to reach farm owners, plantation associations, and agricultural business investors. Token holders will get a share in the income generated from the tokenization of crop production and produce. Epazz CryObo technology will also use solar power for sustainable Bitcoin mining and NFT tokens for farmland tokenization. The company supports sustainable energy sources by creating a cooling technology to control the underground servers' temperature. Story continues Shaun Passley, Ph.D., Epazz Inc. CEO, and Chairman, said, \"Forward cash contracts have been used in the farming business for decades. We are essentially integrating ZenaDrone technology with the CryObo tokenization system to achieve a transparent open ledger digitization of these forward cash contracts which facilitates expanded access to farm investing.\" About CryObo Inc. CryObo Inc. will enhance its software to give early-access companies backed by tangible assets an easy way to access the token markets. The company's platform will change how people transact real estate, digital assets, crops, and raw materials by allowing companies to access the future value of their assets. The growth of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies brings new regulations for large financial service companies, which will require a smart solution to manage their growing portfolios. About Epazz Inc.

Most of my personal savings are in some form of cryptocurrency so please take whatever I say with a grain of salt. Do not invest what you cannot afford to lose Technology There are a couple of points we need to discuss regarding recent developments in the cryptocurrencies world, mainly in bitcoin and the blockchain but not solely, which can trigger a new wave of adoption not only from people in general but also by businesses and governments. For bitcoin and its blockchain, we can mention the two most important recent developments, being debated by many great minds everywhere: (a) Segwit adoption: with the successful softfork that happened during August 2017, which implemented segregated witnessing, it became possible to incorporate more transactions in each block as the transactions became smaller. The problem was that segwit wasnt being adopted worldwide as the transition which had to be made by mining companies and corporate businesses (exchanges for example), was a manual activation. So businesses waited until segwit was proven to be secure and only then activation would happen. There is another version that says activation didnt happen sooner as the overall fees will decrease for mining companies. How is segwit adoption looking over the last 30 days, at the moment of writing? Take your own conclusions! Story continues http://segwit.party/charts/# (it already more than doubled. Couldnt resist, sorry) (b) The Lightning Network (LN): we can finally say its going live ! It already has more than 1500 nodes connected in the testnet and people have already been making real transactions despite the warnings (I love these folk. Theyre the real deal). A recent announcement came this week stating it will finally move onto the first mainnet. https://explorer.acinq.co/#/ Now Lightning Labs , the company behind the original development, is moving to the production environment, meaning, you will have the option to use off-chain payment channels to do transactions. You can now setup a lighting node, which will re-route payments to other nodes, and get paid to do that. Or you can simply start using it as a final consumer, who wishes to send money to another peer, or maybe make a payment to a business; you can count on escrow payments to be immediately implemented and used. Fees paid will decrease exponentially as miners will only register and validate final balances from the off-chain channels onto the blockchain. I cant wait for this to go Live, Im so excited! But if you think great technology developments stop on bitcoin and the blockchain, oh boy youre in for a treat! Other projects have surfaced and past ICOs are starting to bear some of the fruits. I will mention the four I consider top contenders to become massively adopted (I may be massively wrong, please beware): 1. Ethereum : Obviously the most famous project just after bitcoin and for a good reason. Not only is moving into PoS (although PoW will remain working) with its latest close-to-be Casper upgrade which is already being tested. Congratulations to the team, it seems theyre managing to pull out a rabbit out of a hat, this is, moving from one consensus algorithm to another isnt an easy accomplishment, I guarantee you. Not only its improving its own network but due to the many projects around the ethereum protocol, its gaining loads of momentum. Lets discuss some of them: The Raiden Network : it works more or less as the ethereums LN. In a recent update theyve shown how it is possible to do machine-to-machine payments and implement smart-contracts in IoT devices, so that people can interact with them. You really need to watch this talk (if youre not patient start on minute 10:30). Loredana, one of the main developers, did a great job when presenting the latest developments . Modum : this team is building an inter-connected supply-chain for big businesses. Theyre working closely with the Pharma industry and already starting to show progress, as Thilo told me when we spoke over email. I would advise you to pay close attention to this project, as it can become one of the best if correctly implemented . OmiseGo : another project with the touch of Vitalik, the founder of Ethereum. OmiseGo are developing a decentralized off-chain payment solution , to make it easy for people to exchange value over the ethereum network. It seems to be going quite well, as the team is making loads of new announcements and have a quite interesting roadmap laid out for this year. Golem : although it has its own network to monetize computer resources of people connected to it, it uses the ethereum network for payments. Theyve released Brass in the testnet, a CGI super-computer rendering tool that allows designers and artists to quickly render their projects, for a considerably cheaper price than regular rendering farms. Absolutely epic in my opinion, how economic incentives are correctly applied . 2. Cardano : I know theyre still building their own protocol, but honestly the way theyre doing it already deserves its due credit. The idea is to have a fully decentralized protocol that works with PoS and it is easily scalable, even though it integrates smart-contracts. The IOHK team behind Cardano and Ethereum Classic is quite extensive in both knowledge and people. Look at the first Cardano wallet released last year, the Daedalos , which is quite robust and hasnt had any major problems. The academic approach by the team is brilliant as they participate in many conferences and peer-review their papers. I personally love this project, especially due to the amount of activity and commits on github . Compare it to 90% of any other project and see the difference for yourself. Cardano wallet vs IOTA wallet on github 3. IOTA/Circle : Im mentioning both IOTA and Circle, as although I originally was more pro-IOTA, due to the recent issues with the wallet and the lack of clear response by the development team  and also because of that Microsoft partnership ordeal a few months ago  I started looking at alternative DAG projects, like Circle. Both have the same principal, just different teams and approaches. IOTA has been a great project to pave the way for other DAG currencies to appear, like Circle. David is the smart mind behind the first attempt to implement a feeless network. Hopefully both will improve along time and even each other, as we see so many of these projects using cool ideas, concepts and features from different projects and sources. The openness of the field is driving innovation forward in a much faster pace. I hope Im wrong about IOTA and the problems get fixed. Theyre still in a testnet, guided by the founding team, so Im expecting to be put to my place in just a few months as more improvements, nodes and people join the network . 4. Monero : the first widely adopted privacy coin is still very much at play and recent announcements make me believe the technology and team are moving development forward. This makes sense for businesses, governments and people who do not wish to have all their transaction history available for the world to see. I understand privacy and I do not associate it to crimes or shady deeds. People are entitled to doing whatever they want with their money, as long as it is legal right? on a side note, I did not mention many amazing projects like Neo, Stellar, Upfiring, Status, Santiment, WingsDAO, Monaco or ClearPoll for example USABILITY The most important feature of cryptocurrency will be usability, this is, when it becomes as easy to use as bank cards nowadays, things will definitely flip. This is how I see it going ( danger: pure speculation ahead ). Regulators and Governments attack cryptocurrency and ICOs as it is an unlawful way of raising money; It fails and cryptocurrency bounces back, as it has happened during the last couple of years; Banks, Financial institutions and Payments companies attack cryptocurrency as a whole, estimating it is only used for criminal purposes and money laundry; People and companies ignore all the warnings as fees become much lower than traditional banking ones; Previous ICOs will continue to grow and expand its networks to the point traditional companies cannot compete with the new utility and securities business models; Governments and regulators start to adapt and produce new regulation that fosters cryptocurrency growth, as a new way to attract businesses and talent; People start to trust cryptocurrencies more and more, as more projects start to yield results. The losses on bad investments and scams will lower because: (a) People become smarter and wont fall for basic schemes that easily (learning-by-doing). (b) Regulators adapt new regulation to meet criteria that takes into account the digital and transparent nature of many cryptocurrency projects (Government protection). Again, am I being too naive? Maybe, but this is truly what I think will happen eventually. Price fluctuations will become a normal thing, as people start to understand the value of everything is whatever the market determines, including money. When people say governments wont have the power to control the currency, they forget even governments can (a...\n\n[Publisher Feeds (samples)]\n- Cointelegraph: no_data\n- Bitcoin News: no_data\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): USD: 106.050\nEUR: 130.800\nGBP: 148.714\nAUD:  81.807\nNZD:  76.791\nCNY:  16.740\nCHF: 111.420\nBTC: 920,994\nETH: 59,500\nTue Mar 20  08:00 JST || Price action for $BTC on Bitso\n\nIn the last 60 minutes:\nBulls bought 10.303181 BTC \nBears sold 4.602838 BTC\nPrice (BUY/SELL):$159500.00/$159700.00 MXN || Mar 19, 2018 22:00:00 UTC | 8,383.90$ | 6,796.70€ | 5,978.30£ | #Bitcoin #btc pic.twitter.com/isxvP6C9CX || Register Now!

(NYSE: ABBV) and Gilead Sciences (NASDAQ: GILD) are two of the world's biggest biotech stocks. However, their sales have been heading in different directions and each has offered up very different forecasts for 2018. Given that these titans are competing head to head for a share in the multibillion-dollar market for hepatitis C drugs, is one of these stocks a better buy than the other? Grading their growth It can pay to invest in companies that are growing sales and profit. By that measure, AbbVie is undeniably the better of the two stocks. A man in a suit with hands outstretched and palms up. A green dollar sign hovers above one palm, while a red dollar signs hovers over the other. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Because of increased competition from AbbVie and other hepatitis C drugmakers, Gilead Sciences' sales and earnings have been declining since 2016. Gilead Sciences remains a dominant force in HIV treatment, and HIV drug sales have been increasing thanks to the launch of new combination therapies that include TAF, a safer reformulation of the popular HIV drug Viread. However, Gilead Sciences' HIV revenue growth hasn't been able to offset declining demand for the company's hepatitis C medicine, and since sales are falling faster than expenses, the company's earnings are suffering. Gilead Sciences' hepatitis C sales fell 54% year over year to $1.5 billion in Q4 2017. Total revenue declined in 2017 to $26 billion from $30 billion in 2016, and EPS fell to $8.84 from $11.57. It's been a very different story at AbbVie. Growing demand for its best-selling drugs, Humira and Imbruvica, and new drug launches, including Mavyret, the company's latest hepatitis C treatment, are increasing sales by double-digit percentages. Sales of its best-selling drug, Humira, grew 14.6% to $18.4 billion, and revenue from its second best-selling drug, Imbruvica, soared 40.5% to $2.6 billion in 2017. The launch of Mavyret last August boosted AbbVie's hepatitis C revenue by 63% year over year to $510 million in Q4 2017. Those tailwinds translated into full-year sales of $28.2 billion, up 10% from one year ago, and EPS of $5.60, up from $4.82. With AbbVie's revenue and earnings rising and Gilead Sciences still descending, I have to give AbbVie the win in this category. Story continues A scientist studies a medicine capsule. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Pondering pipelines Gilead Sciences invests heavily in mergers and acquisitions and in research and development. And that means it has exciting drugs advancing through its drug pipeline. However, I have to give the advantage to AbbVie in this category, too. Gilead Sciences catapulted to the forefront of research into the use of gene therapies as cancer treatments when it acquired Kite Pharma for $11.9 billion last year, but it faces stiff competition in this field from many competitors, including Novartis (NYSE: NVS) and Celgene (NASDAQ: CELG) , that could limit that market opportunity. Gilead Sciences' Yescarta is the only CAR-T gene therapy on the market for late-stage non-Hodgkin lymphoma currently, but it generated only $7 million in sales since its launch last October. With Novartis' gene therapy, Kymriah, already under priority review for use in Yescarta's indication and Celgene's gene therapy, JCAR017, possibly being filed for FDA approval this year, Gilead Sciences may have to fight tooth-and-nail for market share. Gilead Sciences' filgotinib, an autoimmune-disease drug, and serotinib, a treatment for non-alcoholic fatty liver disease, appear promising, but we won't know just how promising until pivotal data emerges. Filgotinib's phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis data is expected this year, but we may have to wait until next year for more insight on serotinib. Arguably, AbbVie's pipeline has fewer question marks. FDA decisions are pending for Elagolix, an endometrioisis drug, and Venclexta, a chronic lymphocytic leukemia drug, that could eventually lead to blockbuster revenue. AbbVie also has three potential blockbuster drugs that it hopes to file for FDA approval soon: risankizumab, upadacitinib, and Rova-T. Risankizumab has already successfully completed phase 3 psoriasis trials, and a filing is planned by the end of June. Upadacitinib has already put up impressive data in one phase 3 rheumatoid arthritis study, and two more phase 3 studies are expected to have data available shortly that could support a filing before the end of this year. Rova-T may also be filed for approval this year if it delivers strong phase 2 results in third-line or greater small-cell lung cancer. According to management, all three drugs could be multibillion-dollar-per-year top sellers. A man in shirt and tie sits on the floor as paper money falls down around him. IMAGE SOURCE: GETTY IMAGES. Debating dividends Both companies offer income investors market-beating dividend yields, and each company has wads of cash at its disposal to boost dividends in the future. Gilead Sciences initiated its quarterly dividend in 2015, and since then, it's increased the payout from $0.43 to $0.57. Its fat operating margin means it generates more than enough free cash flow to support its dividend even though its sales are falling. In fact, its cash dividend payout ratio is only 23%, significantly lower than AbbVie's, which is north of 50%. Clearly, Gilead Sciences has wiggle room to return more money to investors through dividends. AbbVie's dividend potential may be even more compelling, though. Since being spun out of Abbott Labs in 2013, its dividend has increased by 140%. Given AbbVie's double-digit top- and bottom-line growth, a recent 35% increase to its quarterly dividend payment, multiple potential blockbuster approvals, and a forward dividend yield of 3.3% that's better than Gilead Sciences' 2.8% rate, AbbVie looks better here, too. One more thing The one category where Gilead Sciences shines versus AbbVie is in valuation. AbbVie trades at a forward P/E of 13 and a price-to-sales of 6.4, while Gilead Sciences trades at 12.3 times forward EPS and 3.9 times sales. Clearly, Gilead Sciences is cheaper than AbbVie. That alone might not be enough of a reason to favor it over AbbVie, though. Gilead Sciences is forecasting sales of between only $20 billion and $21 billion this year, down from $25.7 billion in 2016, and if its sales and profit fall faster than feared, then its valuation advantage could fade, especially if AbbVie over-delivers on its outlook for 13% sales growth this year. For this reason, I think AbbVie is the better stock to buy until Gilead Sciences proves its sales and profit have stopped declining.

Here’s what’s happening: Prices: A posturing battle breaks out between crypto titans over the FTX exchange's FTT token, while Solana's SOL token suffers from a post-conference hangover. Crypto traders are looking ahead to this week's midterm elections in the U.S. and a key inflation report. Insights: Speaking the same language as regulators is a ticket to making digital assets mainstream, an opportunity worth trillions. Catch the latest episodes of CoinDesk TV for insightful interviews with crypto industry leaders and analysis. And sign up for First Mover , our daily newsletter putting the latest moves in crypto markets in context. Prices By Bradley Keoun The weekend brought no shortage of crypto-markets drama , but it wasn't about bitcoin: Intense speculation appeared to drive steep losses on the FTX exchange's FTT token and Solana's SOL. The FTX token , which pushed into headlines (and Twitter chatter) last week after CoinDesk reported just how significant of an asset it was on the trading firm Alameda Research's balance sheet , came under additional pressure after Binance CEO Changpeng Zhao tweeted that the firm would sell its remaining holdings of FTT , a stake worth more than $500 million. The FTT price rebounded after the CEO of Alameda, which like FTX is a part of billionaire Sam Bankman-Fried's empire, tweeted that it would happily buy FTT at $22 each. But by late Sunday FTT had reversed course and was falling again, around $22.24, down 7.6% over the past 24 hours. Solana's SOL spiked as Google Cloud announced plans to become a validator on the blockchain network, but by press time it, too, had turned lower and was one of the day's biggest losers among the 162 assets in the CoinDesk Market Index , down 11% over 24 hours. The token had gained in the weeks leading up to Solana's Breakpoint conference currently taking place in Lisbon, Portugal, concluding Monday. These blockchain conferences often bring a slew of announcements that tend to rile up investors, developers and fans, but it's not uncommon for the enthusiasm to fade quickly. Story continues Dogecoin ( DOGE ) , which more than doubled in October to become the top performer in the CMI , is now licking its wounds; the meme token frequently mentioned by billionaire Elon Musk ( Twitter's new owner ) is down 19% so far this month. Bitcoin ( BTC ) , for what it's worth, was trading around $21,000 after hitting a fresh seven-week high on Saturday. The largest cryptocurrency's recent gains has pushed it over key levels on price charts, potentially signaling a crucial shift toward a more bullish trend . Equity markets finished last week on a moderate upswing as the tech-heavy Nasdaq, S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) closed Friday up more than a percentage point – in sync with a 4.7% gain that day for bitcoin. Safe haven gold swung upward 3%, a rare exception to its recent form. Brent crude oil, a widely regarded measure of energy markets, climbed near $99 per barrel, a 5% increase from the start of the week. In the coming week , crypto traders will be focused on Tuesday's midterm elections in the U.S., which might have major implications for regulatory policy or economic decisions. Then, on Thursday, the U.S. Labor Department is due to report the latest reading of the Consumer Price Index, expected to show that the main inflation rate staying at 8% or higher in October – still not too far from a four-decade high, and indicating just how much work the Federal Reserve has to do to cool off the economy and bring the figure back down. \"The midterms and inflation data will no doubt keep market participants busy,\" Deutsche Bank economists wrote in a report. Insight By Sam Reynolds JPMorgan’s Umar Farooq, its blockchain unit boss, said something in very plain language about the future of institutional involvement in crypto during the Singapore Fintech Festival : \"We cannot lose their money.\" Farooq was referring to exactly what it would take for banks to get involved in digital assets. Consumer protection, alongside the ability to identify both parties in the transaction, is key to building a digital assets sector that can be integrated into the world’s banking system and with its trillions in assets. Think about what happens if you send crypto to the wrong wallet. It’s gone, as Coinbase puts it bluntly on a help page. “Due to the irreversible nature of cryptocurrency protocols, transactions can't be canceled or reversed once initiated,” the exchange writes. “Because of this, it is essential to exercise caution when sending and make sure the address you are sending to is an exact match of the recipient's address.” Chainanalysis estimates that around 20% of all bitcoin has been lost in this fashion, and is unrecoverable. Anecdotes of eight-figure amounts effectively evaporating because they were sent to the wrong wallet abound. This certainly happens in the traditional finance world as well. But in TradFi there are ways to reverse these transactions.

Backing these concerns are persistent global financial and macroeconomic tensions, which escalated on Nov. 7 after European Union officials expressed concerns over the $369 billion United States Inflation Reduction Act.The extended tax, health and climate bill was approved in August and it also includes subsidies for electric cars and battery supply chains that are made in North America. According to CNBC, this is not the first time that Europe has expressed its concerns, citing international trade rules and “discriminatory” policies.There’s additional uncertainty coming from the Nov. 8 U.S. midterm elections, which will determine which party controls Congress. Currently, Democrats have a majority in the Lower House, but a change in this status could ease President Biden’s future spending plans.In other news, Apple announced a temporary reduction in iPhone 14 production due to COVID-19 restrictions in China. To put things in perspective, Apple’s $2.2 trillion market capitalization has surpassed the sum of Alphabet (Google) and Amazon.Let’s look at Bitcoin derivatives data to understand if the worsening global macroeconomic conditions have impacted crypto investors.Pro traders were not excited by the rally above $21,000Retail traders usually avoid quarterly futures due to their price difference from spot markets. Still, they are professional traders’ preferred instruments because they prevent the fluctuation of funding rates that often occurs in a perpetual futures contract.Bitcoin 3-month futures annualized premium. Source: LaevitasThe three-month futures annualized premium should trade at +4% to +8% in healthy markets to cover costs and associated risks. The chart above shows that derivatives traders have been neutral to bearish for the past week as the Bitcoin futures premium remained below 2.5% the entire time.More importantly, the metric did not improve after BTC rallied 7% between Nov. 3 and Nov. 5 to test the $21,500 resistance. That price level was the highest since Sept. 13, so the data reflects professional traders’ unwillingness to add leveraged long (bull) positions.Related: Crypto no more in top 10 most-cited potential risks: US central bank reportMargin markets show bulls' resilienceTraders should also analyze the margin trading markets to understand how professional traders are positioned. Margin trading allows investors to borrow cryptocurrency to leverage their trading position. For example, one can increase exposure by borrowing stablecoins to buy an additional Bitcoin position.On the other hand, Bitcoin borrowers can only short the cryptocurrency because they bet on its price declining. However, unlike futures contracts, the balance between margin longs and shorts isn’t always matched.OKX USDT/BTC margin lending ratio. Source: OKXData shows that OKX traders’ margin lending ratio has remained relatively stable at 8 for the past week. From one side, the indicator is somewhat concerning, giving the rally from $20,050 to $21,475 on Nov. 5, which should have positively impacted the margin lending ratio. The present 8.1 level leaves enough room for sustainable leverage buying pressure when the time comes.The metric remains bullish by favoring stablecoin borrowing by a wide margin. In a nutshell, pro traders have been holding bullish positions using stablecoin margin lending.The futures and margin metrics suggest that Bitcoin’s failure to hold the $21,000 support was insufficient in instilling panic in pro traders. The data also shows a modest degree of apathy because the recent 7% rally toward $21,500 was not accompanied by higher demand for leverage longs.Bears continue to exert their strength even as the elusive $25,000 daily close becomes even more distant. Until macroeconomic conditions and political uncertainty dominate the headlines, bulls are less likely to have high hopes of a more sustainable rally.The views and opinions expressed here are solely those of the author and do not necessarily reflect the views of Cointelegraph.com.

The DOJ explained that law enforcement conducted a search at Zhong&#x2019;s house in Gainesville, Georgia, on Nov. 9, 2021, and &#x201C;seized approximately 50,676.17851897 bitcoin, then valued at over $3.36 billion,&#x201D; elaborating: This seizure was then the largest cryptocurrency seizure in the history of the U.S. Department of Justice and today remains the department&#x2019;s second-largest financial seizure ever. Zhong also had about 3,500 more bitcoins from exchanging into BTC over 50,000 bitcoin cash (BCH) which he received following the bitcoin blockchain hard fork in August 2017. He used an overseas cryptocurrency exchange for the conversion. Besides the BTC seized at his house, Zhong began &#x201C;voluntarily surrendering to the government additional bitcoin&#x201D; beginning in March this year, the DOJ revealed, adding that &#x201C;In total, Zhong voluntarily surrendered 1,004.14621836 additional bitcoin.&#x201D; The government is seeking the forfeiture of &#x201C;approximately 51,680.32473733 bitcoin,&#x201D; the DOJ noted.

The CI fiscal year began on Oct. 1, 2021, and ended on Sept. 30, 2022. The tax authority established the Office of Cyber and Forensic Services (CFS) last year to consolidate several areas of investigation, including digital assets, cybercrime, digital forensics, and physical forensics. Lee claimed that the office is capable of tracing essentially any crypto transaction. The report details: Among its priorities, CFS supports criminal investigations agency-wide regarding the illicit uses of digital assets and how they can be used to exploit the U.S. tax and financial system. if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); &#8220;The CFS is constantly taking additional steps to evolve, especially as threats evolve in areas such as decentralized finance [defi], peer-to-peer payments, and anonymity-enhanced cryptocurrencies. Due to relatively limited resources, the CFS focuses on cases where they can have the most significant impact,&#8221; the report adds, elaborating: CI prioritized training and the deployment of cryptocurrency, blockchain, and open-source intelligence technologies to unravel complex cyber-financial criminal schemes. &#8220;When a foreign corrupt government official receives bribes, they often use a third party to move or launder those illegal proceeds to buy properties, cryptocurrencies, and many other assets. If any of the funds move into or through [the] U.S. financial system, CI can trace the money,&#8221; the report further details. What do you think about the IRS building hundreds of crypto cases?

Photo: Mike Marsland/WireImage (Mike Marsland via Getty Images) Boy George needs no introduction, the iconoclast has sculpted his creative persona across the worlds of music, fashion and art. Now the \"Karma Chameleon\" has transformed himself again, this time to become the \"Crypto Chameleon\" as he \"enters the interesting world of NFTs (non-fungible token), far from the snobbery of the art establishment. The legendary Culture Club frontman performed his first gig in the Metaverse at the weekend and took the opportunity to reveal his first NFT project, CryptoQueenz . Boy George has become the latest star to take to the virtual stage of the Vegas City Flamingos Club and emphasised the potential for surrealist digital adventure with NFTs and the Metaverse . The icon of 80s pop superstardom has spent several months creating a series of NFT generative artwork. The digital pieces are based on his Scarman designs and the official drop took place in the premier Opensea NFT marketplace on 1 March. Each digital canvas is programmed to transfer a percentage of sales to the Elton John Aids Foundation and Shelter charities. Watch: Boy George explains why he is drawn to the world of NFT art Boy George spoke to Yahoo Finance UK about his enthusiastic involvement in this digital frontier, where the coders of the crypto \"Wild West\" meet the curators of the art world. He said NFTs are widening the idea of who can sell and who can create a piece of art as well as making it easier for people to express themselves. To explain the excitement around NFTs he recalled an online conversation he had with David Bowie in the 90s when many people thought the internet wouldnt last. Reflecting on that early dial-up chat he said: But look at us now, we all live digital lives. He likened those early days of the internet with the restless energy surrounding the current web3 space, with its NFTs, disruptive cryptocurrencies and the developing Metaverse, that exists beyond the physical world in which we live. Story continues Boy George next to his artwork for the Rankin WaterAid pop-up exhibition launch in February 2022 in London. Photo: Stuart C. Wilson/Getty (Stuart C. Wilson via Getty Images) Read more: How Google is making inroads into the crypto ecosystem The songwriter said that if Bowie, Dali and Picasso were alive today they would be in the thick of it and saying they invented NFTs. He emphasised that we are now experiencing the early days of a new creative movement, saying: What is exciting about the Metaverse and NFTs is where it will go, what will it be and what will it turn into? This enthusiasm is shared by Justin Sun , the founder of the Tron blockchain, who told Yahoo Finance UK that the Metaverse offers so many new possibilities by removing all physical limitations and online art exhibitions are so much more fun than physical ones in many ways, for example, people can fly and can interact with a computer-generated environment and other audiences and visitors from another corner of the world. Watch: Bowie, Dali and Picasso would be heavily involved in NFTs, says Boy George Tabish Khan , visual arts editor at the Londonist told Yahoo Finance UK that the art world is starting to take notice of this disruptive technology. NFTs are a hot market right now and a lot of artists are dipping their toe into it, he said. Lead singer of Russian protest punk rock and performance art group Pussy Riot Nadya Tolokonnikova helped launch a series of NFTs of the Ukrainian flag with all proceeds from the crypto sale going straight to humanitarian and defence missions within the embattled country. Boy George was quick to follow with an auction of an ultra-rare CryptoQueenz NFT, with all proceeds going to the International Committee of the Red Cross, Médecins Sans Frontières and Voices of Children charities. The difference between a traditional charitable fundraiser and an NFT one is that the crypto version uses a publicly visible distributed ledger. Blockchain-based fund transfers are fully transparent and all transactions from donor to the recipient can be monitored and traced.

Photo: Sergio Flores/AFP via Getty (SERGIO FLORES via Getty Images) However, NFTs have been met with a mixed reception from the art establishment. NFTs receive a lot of negative remarks from those in the art world and some of it is justified by their carbon footprint, the scattergun quality of NFTs available at the moment and the often ludicrous prices they are selling for. \"On the other hand, there's always pushback from the notoriously closed art world to any form of new media. He said the new technology was giving the art world jitters of anxiety because NFTs have bypassed established galleries and collectors, these galleries and collectors were in denial at first, but are now starting to accept them as they try to catch up. Sun said the traditional art world is resistant to the changes that NFTs are instigating, as people are afraid of being obsolete and irrelevant, but change is inevitable as it was only last year when people in the art world kept saying NFTs were just a bubble that would burst quickly. Read more: Netflix killers: How crypto film start-ups are using the blockchain to disrupt Hollywood An NFT is a one-of-a-kind crypto asset which enables collectors to authenticate, own and trade original authenticated versions of special digital goods using blockchain technology. They can be anything digital from drawings and paintings to music, but they can also be applied to a physical item. NFTs cannot be replicated or substituted, and can only have one official owner at any given time. They are stored in tamper-proof digital ledgers on the blockchain and when an NFT is bought, the buyer receives a certificate secured in blockchain technology, which makes them the owner of that specific digital asset. Watch: Boy George - NFTs will disrupt the established art world Most NFTs are typically held on the Ethereum blockchain, but other blockchains support them too. Because of their limited supply, a scarcity is engendered giving NFTs resale value and a price appreciation over time. Proponents of NFTs say this technology provides the opportunity for digital self-expression and the ability to exhibit work in an art market that is open to a worldwide audience while cutting out intermediaries. Most NFT artwork has taken on the aspects of the environment in which they exist, so there is a propensity for nostalgic, pixel-based artwork. But now more exciting possibilities are being manifested with artwork that is created algorithmically by artificial intelligence, such as the Aivatars of American photographer Trey Ratcliff. There is also a sub-genre of visual representation of the blockchain itself, called \"On-chain Art\", such as the CryptoArte collection. Each NFT artwork in the collection represents 576 consecutive blocks of the Ethereum blockchain through a meaningful combination of shapes, colours, decorations, according to the CryptoArte website. Read more: Can you live in London for 24hrs using only bitcoin? One CryptoArte NFT currently stands at 0.125 ETH ( ETH-USD ), or approximately £250. Artists are now experimenting with the form and moving past NFTs that are digital alternatives to artworks created using traditional mediums, such as digital illustration, sculpture and paintings. The use of artificial intelligence and automated systems in the creative process has been called \"generative art\" and utilises computer algorithms and large sets of data to independently determine the features of an NFT piece. These artists use coding as well as artistic skills to create their pieces. NFTs are currently suffering alongside the rest of the cryptocurrency ecosystem, with many fearing the market could be spiralling into the long-anticipated Crypto Winter. Last week the daily trading volume across NFT markets dropped by 76% compared to its peak at the beginning of February. NTF supporters hope they will receive mass adoption with NFT marketplaces like OpenSea, Nifty Gateway and Rarible becoming household names alongside eBay ( EBAY ) and Amazon ( AMZN ). OpenSea is the worlds largest NFT marketplace. Photo: Florence Lo/Reuters (Florence Lo / reuters) However, there are risks involved as $1.7m worth of NFTs were stolen from 32 users in a phishing attack on the worlds largest NFT marketplace, OpenSea, in February. In October OpenSea was hacked and $2.7m of NFTs were stolen. Despite this, global NFT market capitalisation grew from $69m to $16bn in the last year. Most of the value across all NFT marketplaces is held within PFPs, or profile picture artworks, according to data from NFTGo. This category amounts to 55% of all the value within the market and is the domain of valuable digital assets as Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yacht Club and Art Blocks. This is where the real money flows and the success of PFPs suggest NFTs have more in common with collectable trading cards, such as baseball or Pokemon cards than with fine art.

Creating limited sets of NFTs has allowed for the formation of exclusive communities of owners who are incentivised to promote their NFT to increase its value. If a community can get a celebrity to buy in, then the value of every NFT in the series sky-rockets. Bored Ape Yacht Club members now include Eminem and Paris Hilton. A more recent NFT collection called World of Women now includes celebrity holders such as Reese Witherspoon and Eva Longoria.

Ether also edged up, while other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies traded flat to higher. Solana’s SOL led the winners. As risk sentiment improved in the wake of weak U.S. inflation data, last week saw an inflow for digital asset investment products after three consecutive weeks of outflows. Meanwhile, the Forkast 500 NFT index moved up after the NFT market logged the largest weekly total transactions since February 2022. U.S. stock futures traded mixed after Wall Street closed higher Monday on the back of a rally led by chipmaker Nvidia.\nBitcoin edged up 0.35% in the last 24 hours to US$29,408.45 as of 07:30 a.m. in Hong Kong, and logged a weekly gain of 0.91%, according toCoinMarketCapdata. The world’s leading cryptocurrency reached a high of US$29,660.25 early Tuesday morning.\nBitcoin’s price has remained largely within the $29,000 to $30,600 range for the past seven weeks, causing frustration among investors seeking higher rewards. However, low volatility could be a blessing in disguise, Nigel Green, founder and chief executive officer of financial management group deVere, said in an emailed statement.\n“This newfound stability attracts institutional investors, who have been historically wary of entering the market due to its extreme price swings,” Green said.\n“This stability is also a boon for businesses and consumers looking for a reliable store of value or medium of exchange,” he added.\nMatteo Greco, research analyst at Canada-based digital asset investment firm Fineqia International, said in an emailed note that low volatility does not necessarily mean low investor interest in the coin.\nGreco pointed to the Bitcoin long-term holder level — a metric that measures the percentage of Bitcoin holders who have held the coin for over 155 days —which reached itshighest ever levelover the first week of August.\n“The data shows how the vast majority of BTC holders did not execute trades in the last few months, as the low volumes and the almost inexistent volatility recorded in the last two months suggest,” said Greco.\n“These numbers are also typical to be observed during the summer months, especially July and August, and do not reflect a decrease in investors’ interest towards the digital asset market,” he added.\nMeanwhile, digital asset investment products saw an inflow of US$29 million in the week ending August 11. That followed three consecutive weeks of outflows totalling around US$144 million, according to a Mondayreportby European alternative asset manager CoinShares. Bitcoin saw an inflow of US$27 million — roughly 93% of the total inflows.\nThe inflows to digital asset investment products are “likely due to the recent U.S. inflation data, which was slightly below expectations, signifying that a September rate hike is less likely,” CoinShares wrote in the report.\nAlong with Bitcoin, Ether gained 0.22% to US$1,844.14 and added 1.05% for the past seven days. Other top 10 non-stablecoin cryptocurrencies all traded higher with the exception of Dogecoin, which inched 0.06% lower to US$0.07477 but gained 2.05% for the week.\nSolana’s SOL led the winners, rising 3.50% to US$25.17 for a 9.42% weekly gain.\nSynesis One, an artificial intelligence (AI) data crowdsourcing platform based on the Solana blockchain, launched its new train-to-earn application “Workspace by Synesis” on Monday.\nThe app allows users to train AIs as data providers while earning cryptocurrencies as rewards. This process, Synesis One claims, will result in a “fully traceable and auditable” data supply chain.\nOutside the top 10 cryptos, HBAR, the utility token of distributed ledger technology platform Hedera Hashgraph, saw its price surge 13.59% in the past 24 hours to US$0.06666. That contributed to a weekly jump of 12.89%.\nHBAR received a boost after Dropp, a Hedera-based micropayments application, wasaddedto the U.S. Federal Reserve’s instant payments platform FedNow. The Fed-run service allows merchants to “accept small-value purchases digitally without paying large transaction fees” following its launch in July.\nThe total crypto market capitalization moved up 0.40% in the past 24 hours to US$1.17 trillion, while trading volume rose 47.95% to US$28.52 billion.\nThe indexes are proxy measures of the performance of the global NFT market. They are managed byCryptoSlam, a sister company of Forkast.News under the Forkast.Labs umbrella.\nThe mainForkast 500 NFT indexmoved up 0.39% in the past 24 hours to 2,486.89 as of 09:50 a.m. in Hong Kong, and notched a 0.27% gain for the week. Forkast’s Ethereum and Polygon NFT indexes also logged gains, while the indexes for Solana and Cardano dropped.\nTotal NFT trading volume rose 22.88% in the past 24 hours to over US$16.48 million, according to data fromCryptoSlam. Volumes on the Ethereum, Solana, Polygon, and Cardano blockchains all logged gains, while volume on the Bitcoin blockchain dipped.\nIn the week ending August 13, NFT sales topped US$101 million after sitting short of US$100 million for three consecutive weeks. Meanwhile, NFT transactions for the week totaled more than 2.80 million, a high not seen since February 2022.\nYehudah Petscher, NFT Strategist at Forkast Labs, commenting on the past week’s surge in NFT sales, said that he saw the emergence of low-priced collections as key to a sustained potential uptick in the market.\n“We’re getting a glimpse of the future of NFTs. More affordable prices, higher volume, likely big brands and this is what we’re seeing in DraftKings, DMarket, Gods Unchained, and Sorare,” said Petscher.\nCombined, Petscher noted, those three collections alone notched 872,185 transactions — nearly a third of the week’s total transactions.\n“The question is, is this sustainable? I think it is, and that’s exactly why this will be the future. Traders haven’t really left NFT, they just ran out of liquidity since there’s no profits. But they can afford NFTs that are priced at just a few dollars,” Petscher added.\nAmong NFT collections, Ethereum-based DeGods saw the largest 24-hour sales volume. The collection surged 144.25% to over US$2.21 million after the projectlaunchedits “Season 3” digital art collection on Sunday.\nRather than introducing new NFTs, Season 3 allows its holders to upgrade their original DeGods NFT and receive four generative artworks.\nMythos Chain-based DMarket and ImmutableX-based Gods Unchained — two video game-adjacent collections — came in second and third place in terms of 24-hour sales volume.\nMeanwhile, global beverage giant Coca-Cola Company introduced its “Masterpiece” NFT collection on Monday. The collection combines classic and contemporary art pieces with virtual coca-cola bottles, the company said.\nThe collection is issued on the Base blockchain, an Ethereum layer-2 network recentlylaunchedby crypto exchange Coinbase.\nU.S. stock futures traded higher as of 11:20 a.m. in Hong Kong following gains at the close of trading Monday. The tech-heavy Nasdaq led the gains with a rise of 0.34%.\nIn Asia, the main stock indexes traded mixed on Tuesday morning. China’s Shanghai Composite, Hong Kong’s Hang Seng and South Korea’s Kospi all logged losses, while Japan’s Nikkei moved higher.\nArtificial intelligence (AI) chipmaker Nvidia Corporation posted a rise of 7.09% on Monday, its highest daily rise since May. That jump followed a note from multinational investment bank Morgan Stanley that described the U.S. tech giant as its “top pick” amid a “massive shift in spending towards AI.”\nNvidia’s highly anticipated quarterly earnings report is due for release next week.\n“It’s the first day in a while that tech has really significantly outperformed,” Jay Hatfield, CEO of U.S.-based investment advisor Infrastructure Capital Advisors,toldReuters.\n“That’s indicative of the fact that you have this blockbuster Nvidia report coming up and that could support the tech market pretty substantially,” Hatfield added.\nU.S. investors now await the release of retail sales data on Tuesday, followed by the U.S. Federal Reserve’s July meeting minutes on Wednesday, for further insight on the health of the U.S. economy and the Fed’s future monetary policies.\nThe Fed meets on Sep. 19 to make its next move on interest rates, which are now between 5.25% to 5.50%, the highest level since January 2001. Analysts at theCME FedWatch Toolpredict a 88.5% chance there will be no interest rate hike in September.\nElsewhere, China’s central bank unexpectedly lowered the rate of its medium-term lending facility (MLF) by 15 basis points to 2.5% on Tuesday, only two months after the previous rate cut in June.\n“The slightly earlier timing and a larger than expected 15 basis point rate cut of MLF show that Beijing feels the urgency to take more policy easing actions to stabilize expectations and growth,” Xiaojia Zhi, chief China economist at international banking group Credit Agricole,toldBloomberg.\nZhi added that China could see more monetary easing in the coming months.\nThe decision was announced shortly before China’s National Bureau of Statisticsreporteddisappointing economic data for July. That data included a rise in the urban unemployment rate, as well as decelerated and smaller-than-expected growth in retail sales and industrial production, according to theWall Street Journal.\n(Updates with equities section.) || Bitcoin edged higher on Tuesday morning in Asia but failed to breach the US$29,500 resistance level.

', \"A recent report by the research firm Delphi Digital illustrates the predictable consistency of price action and trends within the crypto market. The report delves into the interconnectedness between the four-year Bitcoin (BTC) cycle and broader economic trends.\\xa0According to Delphi Digital analysts, the ongoing consolidation at $30,000 is similar to the period between 2015 and 2017, with indicators pointing toward an all-time high (ATH) for Bitcoin by the fourth quarter of 2024.Economic cycle's impact on Bitcoin's performanceDelphi’s analysis draws attention to the inherent cyclical nature of the cryptocurrency market. This cyclicality is demonstrated by the timing between peak-to-trough bottoms, recovery periods to previous cycle highs and the timing of price rallies to new cycle tops. Using Bitcoin as a benchmark, Delphi outlines the general blueprint of a cryptocurrency market cycle.Bitcoin price in USD (log scale) reflecting four-year cycles. Source: Delphi DigitalThese four-year cycles include Bitcoin hitting a new ATH, experiencing an approximate 80% drawdown, then a bottom around one year later. This tends to be followed by a two-year recovery to prior highs and, finally, a price rally for another year leading to a new all-time high.The research reveals a fascinating correlation between Bitcoin price peaks and changes in the business cycle, as indicated by the ISM Manufacturing Index. Bitcoin/USD year-over-year (orange) vs. U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index year-over-year (white). Source: Delphi DigitalDuring Bitcoin’s price peaks, the ISM often demonstrates signs of topping out, and active addresses, transaction volumes and fees reach their highest point. Conversely, as the business cycle signals recovery, so do network activity levels.The report emphasizes the Bitcoin halving’s role in these cycles. The last two halvings occurred about 18 months after BTC bottomed and roughly seven months before a new ATH. This historical pattern indicates a projected new ATH for Bitcoin by the fourth quarter of 2024, aligning with the expected timing of the next halving.Bitcoin price action looks similar to the 2015-2017 pre-bull run phaseThe report also suggests that the current market environment shares striking similarities with the period between 2015 and 2017. The alignment of market behavior, economic indicators and historical trends indicates that the current phase is akin to a time of increased risk exposure and potential growth, just as was experienced during that period. The report notes that the market’s trading patterns, especially in the S&P 500, closely resemble the trajectory observed during 2015-2017. Even during times of uncertainty, such as an earnings recession, these patterns persist, mirroring the sentiment of that period.The consistent pattern of Bitcoin’s cycle, its synchronization with broader economic shifts and the imminent halving in 2024 all contribute to this thesis.U.S. ISM Manufacturing Index, current (orange) vs. 2013-2019 cycle (white). Source: Delphi DigitalDelphi highlights parallels between the bleak global growth outlook during 2015-2016 and the recent period of economic uncertainty in 2021-2022. Factors such as the strength of the U.S. dollar and changes in global liquidity cycles echo the past.The report underscores how gold’s performance around that time, influenced by currency debasement concerns, exhibits remarkable similarities to the present. These parallels bolster the argument that macroeconomic conditions are following a familiar trajectory.Gold price in USD (log scale), current (orange) vs. 2015-2019 cycle (white). Source: Delphi DigitalThe crypto market reflects an optimistic outlook, with some red flagsDelphi’s analysis provides compelling evidence that the crypto market operates within cyclical patterns that mirror broader economic changes. The report’s prediction of a new all-time high by the fourth quarter of 2024 aligns with historical halving patterns. This timing, coupled with the state of indicators like the ISM and expectations of renewed liquidity cycles, strengthens the argument for a cycle akin to the one seen in 2015-2017.The upcoming Bitcoin halving in 2024 further adds credence to the firm's expectations of a possible bull market by the fourth quarter of that year. While the analysis is not without its risks and uncertainties, the overall outlook for the cryptocurrency market in the next 12-18 months appears promising, given the stacking catalysts and historical precedent.This article is for general information purposes and is not intended to be and should not be taken as legal or investment advice.

This has led to a mere 2.9% separation between the asset’s Bollinger Bands, indicating an exceptionally narrow trading range.\\xa0This situation has only been observed twice in Bitcoin’s (BTC)\\xa0history: in September 2016, when BTC traded near $604, and in January 2023, when the asset maintained a steady value of $16,800.As outlined in the report, periods of reduced volatility, combined with investor fatigue, prompt the movement of coins based on their cost close to the current price. This implies that traders are likely making marginal profits or losses with their exits. The report concludes that establishing a new price range is necessary to stimulate fresh spending, potentially contributing to an anticipated increase in volatility.Is Bitcoin’s low volatility a reflection of broader markets?The constrained range within which Bitcoin has traded — specifically, $29,050 to $29,775 over the past three weeks — is atypical, and it does not require advanced mathematical analysis to understand. This has resulted in an exceptionally low annualized 30-day volatility of 17%. The key question is whether this trend is isolated to cryptocurrencies or if it\\'s a phenomenon also observed in the traditional markets, including stocks, oil, bonds and currencies.S&P 500 (blue), WTI (green), DXY (orange), 10-year Treasury (purple) 30-day volatility.

Interestingly, the U.S. Dollar Index (DXY) didn\\'t follow this trend, as the metric rose to 8% from 6% in May 2023. Additionally, the 10-year Treasury yield’s 30-day volatility recently rose from its 18-month low of around 10% to the current 16%. These trends could have potentially influenced the decrease in Bitcoin’s volatility.According to Glassnode, there’s a significant concentration of short-term holders’ price distribution between $25,000 and $31,000. This pattern is reminiscent of similar periods during past bear market recoveries. However, the data shows that many of these investors are still holding positions with losses, creating short-term selling pressure.Entity-adjusted unspent BTC realized price distribution. Source: GlassnodeMoreover, the analytics firm highlights a noteworthy drop in short-term holder supply to a multiyear low of 2.56 million BTC. On the flip side, the supply held by long-term holders has reached an all-time high of 14.6 million BTC, as mentioned in the report.Bitcoin long-term and short-term holder threshold. Source: GlassnodeAssuming a relatively optimistic scenario where only 10% of the 1.77 million BTC held by long-term investors at $47,000 or higher change their positions before Bitcoin surpasses $40,000, this amounts to about six and a half months of the current mining output. This illustrates the importance of not disregarding the potential impact of a global economic recession on Bitcoin’s price, beyond the fact that short-term holders are becoming scarce.This hypothesis doesn’t invalidate Glassnode’s idea of increased positions by “long-term conviction holders.\" Nevertheless, no historical data can account for the U.S. 10-year Treasury yields nearing their highest level in 16 years or the 30-year fixed average mortgage rate in the United States flirting with the 7% mark.Despite the current trend, long-term holders still could flip their sentiment and actions in the event of adverse economic conditions. Higher yields in equities could attract investors, leading to possible volatility, while rising government and corporate borrowing costs might strain budgets and profitability. Concurrently, real estate markets might slow due to the impact on mortgage affordability. Such circumstances would likely compel central banks to implement fiscal policies to support economic activity, often resulting in upward inflation pressure.Bitcoin’s ascension as a $50 billion asset class occurred merely six years ago, making it uncertain how holders will react to the stress faced by some traditional markets. This contradicts the historically low volatility in the S&P 500, oil and Bitcoin markets.

The changes could include a Republican president being elected, SEC Chairman Gary Gensler resigning, and &#8220;crypto mom&#8221; Hester Peirce being appointed as the acting SEC Chair. Possible Changes at SEC That Could Benefit Crypto Industry Former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) official John Reed Stark highlighted potential changes that could benefit the crypto industry, including the approval of spot bitcoin exchange-traded funds (ETFs), in a lengthy tweet on Sunday. Stark is currently president of cybersecurity firm John Reed Stark Consulting. He founded and served as chief of the SEC Office of Internet Enforcement for 11 years. He was also an SEC enforcement attorney for 15 years. A number of companies in the U.S. are seeking SEC approval to launch a spot bitcoin ETF, including Blackrock, the world’s largest asset manager. However, the SEC has not approved any spot crypto ETFs so far. Stark opined: My take is that the current SEC will NOT approve a bitcoin spot ETF application for a range of compelling reasons. The former SEC official referenced Better Markets, a non-partisan independent nonprofit organization advocating for economic security, which outlined on Aug. 9 why the SEC should reject spot bitcoin ETF filings. However, Stark believes that the SEC could undergo changes that benefit the crypto industry if a Republican is elected president of the United States in 2024. The 2024 U.S. elections are scheduled to be held on Nov. 5. He stated: The crypto-regulatory tides could shift exponentially after Election Day. He explained that under a Republican U.S. president, the SEC&#8217;s crypto-enforcement efforts would likely &#8220;decrease significantly.&#8221; He clarified that this could involve focusing more on fraud cases, &#8220;shifting efforts away from charging pure registration violations (such as the failure of a crypto-trading platform to register as an exchange, broker-dealer and clearing firm).&#8221; In addition, Stark expects the new SEC to “become far more receptive to approving a bitcoin spot ETF and far more likely to take other significant crypto-friendly regulatory actions.” if (!window.GrowJs) { (function () { var s = document.createElement(\\'script\\'); s.async = true; s.type = \\'text/javascript\\'; s.src = \\'https://bitcoinads.growadvertising.com/adserve/app\\'; var n = document.getElementsByTagName(\"script\")[0]; n.parentNode.insertBefore(s, n); }()); } var GrowJs = GrowJs || {}; GrowJs.ads = GrowJs.ads || []; GrowJs.ads.push({ node: document.currentScript.parentElement, handler: function (node) { var banner = GrowJs.createBanner(node, \\'MPdnw9B-tTr39Mr-vtbr5r8-uEfsGu9\\', [300, 250], null, []); GrowJs.showBanner(banner.index); } }); The former SEC enforcement official proceeded to explain that when a new U.S. president is elected, the SEC chairman typically resigns and the new chairman position is usually confirmed and filled in a span of three to four months after Inauguration Day. He continued: Hence, should a Republican get elected President, Chair Gensler would likely resign and the senior Republican appointed SEC Commissioner (in this case famed ‘crypto-mom’ Hester Peirce) would possibly become acting Chair. Stark noted that if Peirce “becomes acting Chair of the SEC, given her lengthy track record of dissent and opposition to most crypto-related SEC actions, the world should expect that most U.S. SEC crypto-related enforcement and most crypto-related SEC disruption would grind to a screeching halt.” Last week, Stark warned that the crypto regulatory onslaught will never end under the current SEC.

The bank does not expect the widespread adoption of PYUSD to occur in the near future, noting that the introduction of Paypal&#x2019;s stablecoin will not lead to &#x201C;accelerated regulatory clarity.&#x201D; Nonetheless, Bank of America believes that stablecoins have the potential to provide a more efficient payment solution. Bank of America on Paypal&#x2019;s US Dollar Stablecoin Bank of America published a Global Digital Asset Strategy report last week covering its view on Paypal&#x2019;s U.S. dollar stablecoin and the Fednow payments system. The report was written by Alkesh Shah, head of global crypto and digital assets strategy at Bank of America Global Research, and Andrew Moss, the bank&#x2019;s global digital asset strategist. Paypal (Nasdaq: PYPL) is launching a U.S. dollar-denominated stablecoin, called Paypal USD (PYUSD), which will be available to U.S.-based Paypal customers. According to the payments giant, the stablecoin will be compatible with select third-party digital asset wallets and backed by traditional assets, including the U.S. dollar, short-term Treasuries, and cash equivalents. Noting that Paypal, with 435 million users, is the first global company &#x201C;to launch a stablecoin with regulatory approval,&#x201D; Bank of America stated: We expect PYPL&#x2019;s PYUSD launch to drive payments efficiencies and an improved customer experience over time, but PYUSD adoption is unlikely to be significant in the near term, given lack of wallet compatibility, exchange trading pairs or new functionality. &#x201C;Over the longer term, we expect PYUSD to experience additional adoption headwinds as competition from CBDCs [central bank digital currencies] and yield-bearing stablecoins increases,&#x201D; Bank of America continued. &#x201C;Investors may have been fine holding non-yield-bearing stablecoins, such as USDT and USDC, when rates were close to zero, but yield-bearing stablecoins will likely become increasingly available and attractive with short-term rates above 5%.&#x201D; Regarding crypto regulations, Bank of America stressed: We do not ex...\n\n[Social Samples]\n- Tweets (sample): N/A\n- Reddit (sample): []\n\n[Contextual Past Article (random from prior 60d)]\nArtificial intelligence (AI) will need a digital, automated and always-on payment system to \"stay alive,\" andBitcoinwill be the most sensible currency for AI to utilize, according to Arthur Hayes, co-founder of BitMEX.\nAs the analog banking sector cannot offer the same degree of service, Hayes proposed that a blockchain-based payment system would be necessary to provide the necessary digital infrastructure.\nIn order to reduce the chance of deplatforming, he also emphasized the need for a payment rail that is censorship-resistant and has apparent and obvious standards. Because it is censorship-resistant and limited to 21 million coins, which establishes its worth over time, Hayes claimed that Bitcoin is the best cryptocurrency for AI.\nStablecoins, on the other hand, can be frozen and censored by their issuer, making them less suitable for AI.
