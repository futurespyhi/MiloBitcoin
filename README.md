## 🚀 Quick Start

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/futurespyhi/Milo_Bitcoin.git
cd Milo_Bitcoin

# Install dependencies
conda env create -f environment.yml
conda activate milo_bitcoin

# OR using pip directly
# pip install -r requirements.txt

# Set up environment variables
export NEWS_API_KEY="your_news_api_key"
export OPENAI_API_KEY="your_openai_key"  # for embeddings

# Wake up Milo and start chatting!
python milo_bitcoin_main.py
```

## 💬 Example Conversations

```
🙋 User: "What's Bitcoin's current price?"
🐱 Milo: "Current Bitcoin price is $43,247! The market sentiment 
         is showing 32/100 on Fear & Greed (fearful territory). 
         Network activity is strong with 285k transactions today! 🐾"

🙋 User: "Should I buy Bitcoin?"
🐱 Milo: "I can't give investment advice, but I can help you understand 
         Bitcoin better! Remember: only invest what you can afford to 
         lose completely. Want me to explain dollar-cost averaging? 🐾"

🙋 User: "Explain Bitcoin halving"
🐱 Milo: "Bitcoin halving is like reducing the treat supply! Every ~4 years,
         the reward for mining Bitcoin cuts in half. Next halving: 2028.
         This typically affects supply and demand dynamics... 🐾"
```
